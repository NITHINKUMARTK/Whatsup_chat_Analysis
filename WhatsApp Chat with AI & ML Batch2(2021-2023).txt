05/11/21, 7:07 am - +91 80083 60079: I have appeared for mock test -1

The coding questions are approximately ten questions. 

I don‚Äôt understand, I have captured in pics during the test regarding few questions to solve after test. 
But those questions are not being executed when we run code on IDE.

(the questions of code on the test). 

Please, can anyone help me out with answer?
05/11/21, 7:30 am - +91 92058 52308: Please share the ques.
05/11/21, 8:04 am - +91 98912 03778: Can you pls share the questions.. Thanks
05/11/21, 8:13 am - +91 80083 60079: I have written in my book roughly. I guess you could not understand.
05/11/21, 8:28 am - +91 93988 08159: I guess it‚Äôs kind of pseudo code they gave in the test , they might not be syntactically correct and needs some tweaking
05/11/21, 8:51 am - +91 80083 60079: Yes. Thanks.

05/11/21, 10:03 am - +91 99998 58727: Has anybody confirmed that?
05/11/21, 10:15 am - +91 80083 60079: Mostly I guess. But I‚Äôm not completely sure.

2. (N-2 ) stairs + 2

Finally add both for total no of ways.

06/11/21, 4:00 pm - +91 73825 54571: Due to dussehra and diwali i was away from course and my schedule got disturbed like hectic.i dint complete the last 3 weeks syllbus and now im thinking to study only the notes before atending exams... How would that suffice? Any suggestions
06/11/21, 4:00 pm - +91 94529 09216: If you know these topics from previous, then you can go through notes. It will be fine
06/11/21, 4:01 pm - +91 94529 09216: If not, then we can't comment
06/11/21, 4:01 pm - +91 95000 08014: Referring notes should help in understanding and attempting exams
06/11/21, 4:01 pm - +91 73825 54571: Due to tension i left studying from 1 weeküòÉ
06/11/21, 4:02 pm - +91 95000 08014: Attempt mock exams to evaluate where you need more prep
06/11/21, 4:03 pm - +91 97890 35993: üòÇ same here
06/11/21, 4:03 pm - +91 73825 54571: I agree..thanku
06/11/21, 4:07 pm - +91 78935 18350: It would be tough to cover 3 week topics just with notes in such a short span. My suggestion would be whatever the topics u r are done with, just revise them thoroughly. Last week's content is very little, you can finish in a day. SQL basic commands and operations also won't take much time. So, you hardly left with 2-3 topics. If you have time, go with them. Otherwise revise finished topics. You could score 70% easily otherwise with the tension in mind, whatever u learnt also will be forgotten.
06/11/21, 4:08 pm - +91 73825 54571: Super.thankuüôè
06/11/21, 4:09 pm - +91 70877 58526: I have the same issue. This is some really good advice
06/11/21, 4:09 pm - +91 97110 42979: One more way I did...increase video speed while revision or familar  topics ..help to save time
06/11/21, 4:10 pm - +91 73825 54571: Dont increase speed. U may save time but wont get fruits out of it
06/11/21, 4:10 pm - +91 78935 18350: Yes, a good way to revise.
06/11/21, 4:10 pm - +91 73825 54571: Completing syllabus is not imp.completing perfectly is important
06/11/21, 4:12 pm - +91 78935 18350: Yes, as sir told in today's live session "Essentials of AI" will be an easy scoring subject. So no need to worry even if we didn't get great marks in mid term. If we score decently, we can cover lost marks with extra hard work in semester end exam.
06/11/21, 4:12 pm - +91 73825 54571: Seriously... 1 year tight schedule this is...not giving time to festivals and avoiding many necessary things also becomming mandatory
06/11/21, 4:13 pm - +91 78935 18350: Diploma is indeed a rigourous curriculum
06/11/21, 4:14 pm - +91 73825 54571: Depends from person to person
06/11/21, 4:54 pm - +91 99850 33894: Syllabus for mid examination is upto *Regular Expressions* as per given schedule
06/11/21, 4:56 pm - +91 92058 52308: No syllabus it till week 7 SQL.
06/11/21, 4:56 pm - +91 72045 68400: Next week Sunday 14 exam is the first midterm right ? 

From maths foundations to SQL , yeah ?
06/11/21, 4:56 pm - +91 92058 52308: Yes
06/11/21, 4:57 pm - +91 72045 68400: We also have sem end exam and that is different from this ?
06/11/21, 4:57 pm - +91 97890 35993: Yes
06/11/21, 4:58 pm - +91 72045 68400: That again Includes this subject -1 also right?

 this mid term exam score counted for final score , yeah ?
06/11/21, 4:59 pm - +91 97890 35993: I think so
06/11/21, 5:00 pm - +91 72045 68400: Okay!
06/11/21, 5:02 pm - +91 94529 09216: 10 % : attendance and assignment
40% + 40% : mid sem exam

06/11/21, 5:03 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think there will be 4 mid term exams
06/11/21, 5:03 pm - +91 94529 09216: 2 per sem

06/11/21, 6:18 pm - +91 95000 08014: For every subject you will have 1 mid term and final post semester
06/11/21, 6:21 pm - +91 99116 67917: Man, this course is huge, finishing is taking a huge toll, revising in time is now not an option for me. Don't know will I perform in the mid-term.
06/11/21, 6:22 pm - +91 73825 54571: I decided to take this course-1  as a trial for rest of syllabus.

Now this subject 1 exam is the mid term right?
06/11/21, 6:23 pm - +91 96184 80572: I am
06/11/21, 6:23 pm - +91 72045 68400: The marks for this is the final right?
06/11/21, 6:24 pm - +91 99116 67917: They said with practice we will get better, but they never said that they won't give time for it.
06/11/21, 6:24 pm - +91 73825 54571: No time yeah
06/11/21, 6:25 pm - +91 99116 67917: Kinda 40 - 60 type. 40% from this and 60 from Post mid term as final (As per my guess)
06/11/21, 6:25 pm - +91 90357 92877: Fully finished?
06/11/21, 6:26 pm - +91 99165 48094: For people who are working out is becoming very difficult to complete the course contents on time

06/11/21, 6:27 pm - +91 95000 08014: Yes, you will get weekly curriculum similarly for every subject and once the portion for any subject is done, will have mid term exam for that subject
06/11/21, 6:28 pm - +91 95000 08014: The first sem exam will be sometime in 2nd week of march 2022

06/11/21, 6:31 pm - +91 90357 92877: I am also a student of their ML course and I've finished almost 10 assignments there
But in the diploma they have gone in much more detail with regards to programming, I'm currently working and still yet to cover the time complexity and dynamic programming partüòÖ
06/11/21, 6:35 pm - +91 99116 67917: Nice bro !!! 

Completed 10 assignments, so you might have completed the whole semester.

 Are the Diploma assignments similar to ML course assignments or easier or hard?
06/11/21, 6:36 pm - +91 92058 52308: I am
06/11/21, 6:40 pm - +91 90357 92877: The assignments are different actually,
In the diploma so far the assignments are just mcq questions, atleast till where I have completed
In the other course we have only 1 assignments related to programming, rest are all ML related where we have to build the model and send the code for review
When the ML part starts the course will be interesting, the programming part which we are studying now is a bit boring to be honestüòÇ
06/11/21, 6:41 pm - +91 92058 52308: Yes, diploma have much depth and breadth.
 time complexity ,OOP, DP not covered in AAIC.
06/11/21, 6:42 pm - +91 92058 52308: Agreed
06/11/21, 6:42 pm - +91 99116 67917: Man, I am wondering if without ML is taking this much time to complete and understand then the ML part will take to be the next level to complete.
06/11/21, 6:43 pm - +91 88988 90243: I think it's covered
06/11/21, 6:45 pm - +91 99208 18609: Does anyone have list of topics (prerequisites) for mathematics?
06/11/21, 6:52 pm - +91 90357 92877: I think that part will be easier and manageable, but yeah...these time complexity and DP parts are important for interviews
06/11/21, 6:53 pm - +91 76740 22781: ‚úã
06/11/21, 6:59 pm - +91 83329 81498: Me too. Finished the videos. Have the finish the deep learning assignments and case studies.
06/11/21, 7:00 pm - +91 83329 81498: Took a break to finish diploma course and device AAIC
06/11/21, 7:00 pm - +91 83329 81498: Revise*
06/11/21, 7:13 pm - +91 99877 12457: Limits, Derivatives and Plot visualzation from equations !

06/11/21, 8:14 pm - +49 179 4111257: <Media omitted>
06/11/21, 8:15 pm - +91 95000 08014: I tried attempting mock test 1, Practical lesson learnt: be careful with MSQs as the no of such questions are very high and you will not get any marks if your answer is partially correct or you do not select all options.
06/11/21, 8:16 pm - +91 95000 08014: This was clarified in today's live session
06/11/21, 8:17 pm - +91 88704 19945: Damn. JEE exam flashbacks üòÇ
06/11/21, 8:17 pm - +91 95000 08014: However we can seek clarification by replying to same comment where it is mentioned as mandatory
06/11/21, 8:19 pm - +91 88640 27876: Guys, what if complete this  diploma in 1 and half year

06/11/21, 8:20 pm - +91 95000 08014: You Have two years to complete the diploma. Only thing is about placements
06/11/21, 8:20 pm - +91 88640 27876: I don't need any placement
06/11/21, 8:21 pm - +91 80083 60079: You can do it, but you got to keep it for 24 months only.
06/11/21, 8:21 pm - +91 88640 27876: I am already in Central government job
06/11/21, 8:21 pm - +91 88640 27876: I am Doing it out of interest, I don't want to take so much pressure
06/11/21, 8:22 pm - +91 80083 60079: Man of vision. üëçüèº
06/11/21, 8:22 pm - +91 95000 08014: Only challenge for you will be in understanding and your participation in live sessions will be less if you don't go by weekly curriculum
06/11/21, 8:22 pm - +91 80083 60079: I mean you are focused on completion of course, that‚Äôs good.
06/11/21, 8:23 pm - +91 80083 60079: True.
06/11/21, 8:23 pm - +91 95000 08014: For you the live sessions recording will be a recorded video
06/11/21, 8:23 pm - +91 88640 27876: This course is too much packed you can't take break on weekend also for 1 year
06/11/21, 8:23 pm - +91 73825 54571: Pressure and risks are there in every sector
06/11/21, 8:23 pm - +91 88640 27876: Yes
06/11/21, 8:23 pm - +91 80083 60079: As mentioned by date of live sessions.

06/11/21, 8:24 pm - +91 88640 27876: It all depend on you How you react to life
06/11/21, 8:24 pm - +91 80083 60079: But this is like pressure cooker for our brains üòÇ
06/11/21, 8:24 pm - +91 80083 60079: This course*
06/11/21, 8:25 pm - +91 88640 27876: It is like feeding too much information even Jee preparation was easier
06/11/21, 8:25 pm - +91 95000 08014: Agreed, but it's fun to be in such situation. It's also overwhelming for me but since I come from non-technical iam enjoying this stress
06/11/21, 8:25 pm - +91 94529 09216: But I don't think you have to take any pressure when you are learning from Srikant sir
06/11/21, 8:25 pm - +91 88640 27876: Yes he is amazing
06/11/21, 8:26 pm - +91 94529 09216: My personal experience , as i have learnt from him in applied ai course and interview preparation course
06/11/21, 8:26 pm - +91 80083 60079: Yes.
06/11/21, 8:26 pm - +91 95000 08014: Totally agree, his training is methodical, pragmatic and tailor made. Moreover he is very candid
06/11/21, 8:26 pm - +91 80083 60079: Even you have joined in interview prep course?
06/11/21, 8:27 pm - +91 94529 09216: A yeare black
06/11/21, 8:27 pm - +91 94529 09216: Completed
06/11/21, 8:27 pm - +91 94529 09216: *back
06/11/21, 8:27 pm - +91 95000 08014: How is this course, I remember he said in one of the sessions that this course gives good foundation if you are aiming for MLE
06/11/21, 8:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: It's meant for product based company
06/11/21, 8:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: Covers aptitude, data structures and algorithms,
06/11/21, 8:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: And also few more things related to software design
06/11/21, 8:29 pm - +91 73585 96079 left
06/11/21, 8:29 pm - +91 95000 08014: Is the course content too technical and complex to understand for some one from non tech
06/11/21, 8:29 pm - +91 94529 09216: This message was deleted
06/11/21, 8:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: May be , if you are from non tech
06/11/21, 8:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: Well I can't say it , as I have done b.tech
06/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 94529 09216: So no idea how much a non tech guy can grasp
06/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 94529 09216: From hin
06/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 94529 09216: *him
06/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 78935 18350: Yeah, for non tech people it bit hard to catch up at first..so regular practice makes things easier. But it's not preferable to take along with Diploma.. the course itself is a 200+hr course
06/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 95000 08014: Ok
06/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 94529 09216: Totally agree sir
06/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 97890 35993: I am from non technical. I did understood few topic but topic like time complexity and space, that dynamic programming part went right over my head. And i am still not able to recall
06/11/21, 8:32 pm - +91 95000 08014: Yes, it will be too much now. But I may opt for it post diploma
06/11/21, 8:32 pm - +91 78935 18350: Ya better to opt after diploma
06/11/21, 8:33 pm - +91 88640 27876: I am from mechanical, so far This course is very easy but I am not getting time. I am not able to get time after my regular office work
06/11/21, 8:34 pm - +91 88640 27876: Only 3-4 days I can study
06/11/21, 8:34 pm - +91 88640 27876: It should for 1.5 years
06/11/21, 8:37 pm - +91 94529 09216: So, you can take just 1.5 -2 hrs per day, no mobile and nothing, full focus study , and you will be surprised to see the results, believe me , it will me more than 4 hrs of normal study
06/11/21, 8:37 pm - +91 88640 27876: I will try this
06/11/21, 8:37 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think 95% are working professional only
06/11/21, 8:38 pm - +91 94529 09216: Just no mobile that is enough
06/11/21, 8:48 pm - +91 77748 96465: +1
06/11/21, 8:48 pm - +91 77748 96465: Studying without mobile works like charm
06/11/21, 8:49 pm - +91 73825 54571: +1
06/11/21, 8:49 pm - +91 94529 09216: Definitely

09/11/21, 2:01 pm - +91 95668 19500: Mee too‚òùÔ∏è
09/11/21, 2:01 pm - +91 99721 79093: Don't delay mock complete it asap, you will know which topics to focus and can prepare accordingly
09/11/21, 2:02 pm - +91 99116 67917: Will their be re-test for failing ?
09/11/21, 2:02 pm - +91 99721 79093: You will get summary after mock which is very helpful fo revision
09/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 89715 68712: True. Actually I didn't think that they would ask math too, the calculus part, I didn't make a proper notes for that. If anyone have neat notes for math part. Plz share.
09/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 99721 79093: For mock or actually mid semester?
09/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 99116 67917: Mid and post mid semester exams
09/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: Not advise. Dynamic programming is tough compared to other topics. I'm glad that I did move on to other topics instead of getting stuck there. Dp is still incomplete for me but I have covered all the video content. Assignment still pending. Planning to complete today itself
09/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 99721 79093: Yes bro, obviously
09/11/21, 2:04 pm - +91 77748 96465: Those who have taken mock test... can u guys tell the level of difficulty of test?
09/11/21, 2:05 pm - +91 99116 67917: Great, I have no chance to clear this one. Way behind the schedule.

09/11/21, 2:06 pm - +91 99721 79093: My consolidated notes for calculus
09/11/21, 2:06 pm - +91 97890 35993: Same for me
09/11/21, 2:06 pm - +91 89715 68712: Thanks bro üòä
09/11/21, 2:07 pm - +91 99721 79093: I tried to summarise the whole calculus topic in 33 points
09/11/21, 2:07 pm - +91 97890 35993: Thanks
09/11/21, 2:07 pm - +91 99721 79093: Don't lose hope bro, give it your best
09/11/21, 2:07 pm - +91 89715 68712: I only hope most questions are on SQL üòÇ
09/11/21, 2:08 pm - +91 99721 79093: Haha
09/11/21, 2:08 pm - +91 72045 68400: Hi..

Can we re take mock tests ? After the tests do we get the results instantly ?
09/11/21, 2:08 pm - +91 99116 67917: Thank you so much. Will surely revise from this. My writing and notes are way beyond my understanding now.
09/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 99721 79093: You get results instantly
09/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 99721 79093: üòé‚úåüèª
09/11/21, 2:11 pm - +91 99721 79093: Same what sir told, 15 are easy, need to apply logic for medium and hard question
09/11/21, 2:11 pm - +91 72045 68400: We cannot retake it, right?

Also, is it proctor based on video session ?
09/11/21, 2:12 pm - +91 99721 79093: Yup
09/11/21, 2:13 pm - +91 72045 68400: Okay. Thanks
09/11/21, 2:15 pm - +91 96505 18893: I did the same
09/11/21, 2:17 pm - +91 70734 10928: Hi, can you share for live sessions if you have prepared?
09/11/21, 2:18 pm - +91 99721 79093: I am sorry I didn't do that
09/11/21, 2:18 pm - +91 99721 79093: But I have to for linear algebra
09/11/21, 2:19 pm - +91 70734 10928: Okay no problem. Actually it is very difficult to go through these long videos.. that's why I didn't make the notes that time.

09/11/21, 2:20 pm - +91 99721 79093: For programming related ones I just practiced the colab note books
09/11/21, 2:21 pm - +91 70734 10928: That sir provided, right ?
09/11/21, 2:21 pm - +91 99721 79093: Exactly
09/11/21, 2:21 pm - +91 99721 79093: This message was deleted
09/11/21, 2:22 pm - +91 99721 79093: That's more than enough
09/11/21, 2:22 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes, but new question takes time for me.
09/11/21, 2:23 pm - +91 99721 79093: Ya that's you need to practice and break the code and see the edge cases
09/11/21, 2:24 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes, but practice demands time..and didn't give time for practicing üòÄ
09/11/21, 2:26 pm - +91 99721 79093: That's life
09/11/21, 2:26 pm - +91 99721 79093: :D
09/11/21, 2:33 pm - +91 88704 19945: Just wanted to confirm this because I guess I read this in mock test instructions, we can use Google calculator during the exam right? Nothing else is allowed
09/11/21, 2:33 pm - +91 99721 79093: yup
09/11/21, 2:33 pm - +91 88704 19945: Cool, thanks!
09/11/21, 2:34 pm - +91 99721 79093: Google calculator and inbuilt computer calculator
09/11/21, 2:34 pm - +91 99721 79093: don't even connect your headphone
09/11/21, 2:35 pm - +91 88704 19945: I did that sinx/x limit question using calculator only. We can make use of calculators for such question I guess
09/11/21, 2:36 pm - +91 99721 79093: Oh I didn't get this idea
09/11/21, 2:36 pm - +91 99721 79093: I was trying to solve the equation
09/11/21, 2:36 pm - +91 88704 19945: I suck at limits. I guess using calculator would help us all
09/11/21, 2:37 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm, basically calculate the result for X -1 -2 0 1 and 2
09/11/21, 2:37 pm - +91 99721 79093: And find the Y values right?
09/11/21, 2:38 pm - +91 88704 19945: Nope. Sin(0.000001)/0.000001
09/11/21, 2:38 pm - +91 88704 19945: Do it on calculator
09/11/21, 2:38 pm - +91 88704 19945: You will get the answer
09/11/21, 2:38 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm
09/11/21, 2:38 pm - +91 99721 79093: Got it
09/11/21, 2:38 pm - +91 99721 79093: This is a good hackü§©
09/11/21, 2:39 pm - +91 88704 19945: Yeah. And for infinity we can use 10000000 plus or minus
09/11/21, 2:39 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm
09/11/21, 2:40 pm - +91 88704 19945: Luckily got this idea during mock exam. Otherwise it's too difficult to solve. Folks, feel free to drop more tricks if you know!

09/11/21, 4:29 pm - +91 99721 79093: We don't have these exams in applied ai course right?
09/11/21, 4:30 pm - +91 90357 92877: Nope
Only assignments, course validity is 1 year
09/11/21, 4:30 pm - +91 99721 79093: Oh I see
09/11/21, 4:34 pm - +91 89715 68712: So true. üòÇ
09/11/21, 4:35 pm - +91 89715 68712: No. Just assignments. Actually I have done applied ai course like 80%, I then got job and now working as a senior Data analyst and again back to applied roots.
09/11/21, 4:35 pm - +91 99721 79093: Super dude!
09/11/21, 4:37 pm - +91 99721 79093: So do we have a success story of you in youtube channelüòÖ
Just curious

09/11/21, 4:40 pm - +91 89715 68712: Nahi bhai. Course sabh theek tha, at a point I thought to give up. Actually lot of times I thought to give up, maine 10 months gap leke kiya tha this course.
09/11/21, 4:40 pm - +91 94529 09216: Even I have done the applied ai course
09/11/21, 4:40 pm - +91 94529 09216: But couldn't complete whole syllabus
09/11/21, 4:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: Got busy in campus placement
09/11/21, 4:41 pm - +91 90388 76605: What about Job Guarantee then? Need to complete the whole syllabus?
09/11/21, 4:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: You need to complete 30 mandatory assignment
09/11/21, 4:42 pm - +91 95610 76941: They don't provide I guess, only Job assistance
09/11/21, 4:42 pm - +91 89715 68712: If you can finish that 30 assignments, trust me. Any job interview I can crack
09/11/21, 4:42 pm - +91 99721 79093: How are these assignments
09/11/21, 4:42 pm - +91 99721 79093: Are gonna have the same in diploma also?
09/11/21, 4:42 pm - +91 90388 76605: Cool.. sometimes the course feels little overwhelming. But at the end of the day it's very good tbh.
09/11/21, 4:43 pm - +91 90388 76605: I think we already did some right?
09/11/21, 4:43 pm - +91 94529 09216: No
09/11/21, 4:43 pm - +91 99721 79093: Those are just hacker rank problems
09/11/21, 4:44 pm - +91 94529 09216: We need to build full fledged model
09/11/21, 4:44 pm - +91 94529 09216: For every algorithms we learn
09/11/21, 4:44 pm - +91 99721 79093: I am waiting for this dude, I don't actually care about exam marks
09/11/21, 4:45 pm - +91 90388 76605: Ohh those were mandatory exercises then
09/11/21, 4:45 pm - +91 89715 68712: No idea
09/11/21, 4:45 pm - +91 94529 09216: But this exam is really very important
09/11/21, 4:45 pm - +91 99721 79093: Then I buy the applied AI course today
09/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 94529 09216: That's major advantage of this diploma over ai course
09/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 89715 68712: Some were nightmares. üòÇ I cracked jobathons on analytics vidya in a easy way, but these assignments were tougher than that. üòÇ
09/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 89715 68712: Dude. No. Your already in this right, then why you want to buy that again?
09/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 99721 79093: I can't justify my skill based on marks in an interview bro
09/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 94529 09216: It really becomes nightmare after 15 assignment i think ü§£ü§£
09/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 89715 68712: True. üòÇ
09/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 99721 79093: Oh sounds scary
09/11/21, 4:47 pm - +91 90388 76605: How did you guys performed in the mock tests ? Have anyone taken it?
09/11/21, 4:47 pm - +91 94529 09216: I am not taking about marks, I am just saying this exam will help you collect your whole journey of learning
09/11/21, 4:47 pm - +91 89715 68712: I have seen people paying 2.8 lakhs and stuff for online data science courses and lol they are working under me and I am in a better position. But sad part is, very less companies know about applied ai course.
09/11/21, 4:47 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm point.
09/11/21, 4:48 pm - +91 99721 79093: Applied AI is an unpolished diamond
09/11/21, 4:48 pm - +91 89715 68712: For me messed up. I got over confidence and didn't study much. And in this course on oops, recursion all those are added. Those were not present in applied ai course.
09/11/21, 4:48 pm - +91 94529 09216: I am just saying this because as a student of applied ai course I have felt this thing
09/11/21, 4:48 pm - +91 94529 09216: You start giving less important to the course
09/11/21, 4:49 pm - +91 94529 09216: Because of no exam or regulation
09/11/21, 4:49 pm - +91 89715 68712: Damn true. Idk why they are not getting lot famous though, some boring courses are giving so many ads and stuff. But these people don't.
09/11/21, 4:49 pm - +91 90388 76605: Right, me too.. surprisingly I did good on maths and not in python.
09/11/21, 4:50 pm - +91 89715 68712: Exactly. For me the medium level questions were easy and basic questions on math were tough in mock üòÇ
09/11/21, 4:50 pm - +91 99721 79093: Python need to be very careful on the edge cases
09/11/21, 4:50 pm - +91 90357 92877: I think they are pretty famous already...I had read somewhere that in 3 years they have almost 3k enrollments for their ML course
09/11/21, 4:50 pm - +91 90388 76605: Right..üòÖ
09/11/21, 4:51 pm - +91 90388 76605: And with time their reputation will grow. Also if you notice as they are keeping adding new topics in live session
09/11/21, 4:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: One of my friend has paid 4.5 lakhs to UPGRAD, and he literally knows nothing about the underlying mathematics behind any algorithm
09/11/21, 4:51 pm - +91 90388 76605: So after 2-3 years the students will get much more contents.
09/11/21, 4:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: They are more focused on tools
09/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 99721 79093: Even I got a call from these UPGRAD marketing people
09/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 89715 68712: So true. I know lot of people from great learning, same stuff.
09/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 99116 67917: Although the course structure is very good but very few are there who properly complete the entire course and assignments on time or before. Many lose hope in between due to struggles of understanding or an increase in the complexity of assignments. Hence, it is not that famous.
09/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 90388 76605: I recently conducted many interviews in TCS for ninja..now-a-days I see everyone in btech doing classes on Upgrads or scalar but they know nothing
09/11/21, 4:53 pm - +91 94529 09216: The most important thing is mathematic , and no course can explain you better math than srikant sir
09/11/21, 4:53 pm - +91 99721 79093: üíØ
09/11/21, 4:53 pm - +91 89715 68712: True. And I have seen lot of people, in this course they are like craving for job instead of focusing on gaining knowledge. I can understand job is important but why will the company pay if we have don't have knowledge. Simple üòÖ
09/11/21, 4:53 pm - +91 94529 09216: In interview they will play with math only
09/11/21, 4:55 pm - +91 88640 27876: Bro I have joined it only for learning, I don't need any job Infact my present job is much better then any job which I get in placement
09/11/21, 4:55 pm - +91 99116 67917: Whenever Applied Roots publish interviews everyone says the same thing the irrespective of the assignments' toughness they solved, they are now capable of deploying model from scratch. As many outsider courses are just teaching the tool and due to that many learners don't know how to built the model from scratch and implement them.
09/11/21, 4:56 pm - +91 99116 67917: How about you refer me the to your current job during placementsü§£

09/11/21, 5:13 pm - +91 88704 19945: 3 years experience.
09/11/21, 5:13 pm - +91 88844 76831: ‚úãüèª

09/11/21, 5:14 pm - +91 99721 79093: I was planning to learn French to increase score
09/11/21, 5:14 pm - +91 88704 19945: There was a course on udemy for ielts. It really helped me.
09/11/21, 5:14 pm - +91 89715 68712: Ya. I checked with team initially, it's based on WES point system, so it is considered as 1yr Program. Like a diploma
09/11/21, 5:15 pm - +91 89715 68712: Cool. üëå
09/11/21, 5:15 pm - +91 88844 76831: What is the name of the course... I found one called fluently
09/11/21, 5:15 pm - +91 70877 58526: Ohh good.
09/11/21, 5:15 pm - +91 99721 79093: This will add atleast 30-40 points
09/11/21, 5:16 pm - +91 89715 68712: Actually I am sort of confused guy, like regarding canada or india. In india I can get upto 30-35lpa may be another 3-4 yrs. In internet, people are like if you earn more than 30+, Canada is a bad idea. I just am confused.
09/11/21, 5:16 pm - +91 88704 19945: I will check it and let you know. The instructor name was Kieno Campbell or something
09/11/21, 5:16 pm - +91 99116 67917: https://www.udemy.com/course/ielts-band-7-preparation-course/
09/11/21, 5:16 pm - +91 89715 68712: Share the link to me too. How much scores you got?
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 88844 76831: There are so many channels on YouTube who give mixed reviews regarding Canada...
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 88704 19945: 9 8.5 8 7
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 89715 68712: But I heard french is very tough like to get fluent with
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 99721 79093: And you will pay 30% in taxes
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 88844 76831: Thank u so muchüòä
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 89715 68712: Exactly. Some say it's worth, and some say. No jobs etc.
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 99116 67917: üëçüëç
09/11/21, 5:17 pm - +91 89715 68712: But the health and schooling etc are free I guess.
09/11/21, 5:18 pm - +91 89715 68712: Oh that's good one.
09/11/21, 5:18 pm - +91 99721 79093: I am talking about india
09/11/21, 5:18 pm - +91 88844 76831: One couple returned back because they were able to get only survival jobs whereas some are getting better opportunities...
09/11/21, 5:18 pm - +91 99721 79093: Yes that's why planning to go to Canada
09/11/21, 5:18 pm - +91 88704 19945: I could have scored more. Suggestion from my end, schedule speaking on a different day
09/11/21, 5:18 pm - +91 88844 76831: Yea
09/11/21, 5:18 pm - +91 88704 19945: After 3 hours of test you won't feel like giving interview
09/11/21, 5:19 pm - +91 89715 68712: Ya here tho.  Health tho alag hi baat hai
09/11/21, 5:19 pm - +91 99721 79093: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
09/11/21, 5:19 pm - +91 89715 68712: When I gave IELTS Academic, interview was a day before.
09/11/21, 5:19 pm - +91 99721 79093: 7 out of 100 in india pay direct taxes. 7!üòÑ
09/11/21, 5:20 pm - +91 99721 79093: As soon as I get a PR I will apply for jobs in Canada from india itself
09/11/21, 5:20 pm - +91 89715 68712: True. Some are like, go for Canada using PGD some 1 yr course and you can get there like easily and stuff. But leaving a data science job and studying a 1 yr masters and starting from data analyst internship again. Is like to weird. And even costly
09/11/21, 5:20 pm - +91 88844 76831: Has anybody taken help from canapprove???
09/11/21, 5:21 pm - +91 88844 76831: Right...
09/11/21, 5:22 pm - +91 89715 68712: Exactly. Same. However will have 1 yr time, so can apply and wait. If we get within a year cool. If not, stay in india üòÇ. Kaise bhi packages here for data science and more.
09/11/21, 5:25 pm - +91 97396 15111: Express entry is still tough the best way to get in would be PNP
09/11/21, 5:25 pm - +91 97396 15111: My score was 440
09/11/21, 5:25 pm - +91 99721 79093: PNP you need province sponsorship right?
09/11/21, 5:26 pm - +91 97396 15111: No
09/11/21, 5:26 pm - +91 97396 15111: You can apply directly
09/11/21, 5:26 pm - +91 99721 79093: Oh
09/11/21, 5:26 pm - +91 89715 68712: But company must give the work visa right?
09/11/21, 5:26 pm - +91 99721 79093: But do they have a specific criteria
09/11/21, 5:26 pm - +91 97396 15111: No
09/11/21, 5:27 pm - +91 97396 15111: Places like Prince Edward Island, Manitoba , New  foundland  these places you can directly apply PNP
09/11/21, 5:27 pm - +91 97396 15111: But the point is we need to go to places which have jobs for us
09/11/21, 5:28 pm - +91 97396 15111: And those places are Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal Quebec
09/11/21, 5:28 pm - +91 89715 68712: Wouldn't that be same as express entry?
09/11/21, 5:29 pm - +91 97396 15111: From my research Ottawa is the only province looking for an Express entry
09/11/21, 5:29 pm - +91 89715 68712: Like what is the major difference?
09/11/21, 5:29 pm - +91 97396 15111: Other we can directly apply PNP
09/11/21, 5:29 pm - +91 97396 15111: PNP is slightly costlier than express entry
09/11/21, 5:29 pm - +91 97396 15111: But higher chances of getting a PR
09/11/21, 5:29 pm - +91 89715 68712: Costlier in the way of showing funds?
09/11/21, 5:30 pm - +91 97396 15111: Plus if you get a PR you need to work in that Province for 2 or 4 years
09/11/21, 5:30 pm - +91 97396 15111: No processing fees
09/11/21, 5:31 pm - +91 97396 15111: The easiest way to get to Canada would be to going to study there that way is a sure shot way of getting a PR
09/11/21, 5:31 pm - +91 89715 68712: Ya but it's a waste of time and money. Almost a year and 25lakhs
09/11/21, 5:32 pm - +91 99721 79093: But again 2 years with a student job will be very difficult
09/11/21, 5:32 pm - +91 99721 79093: Exactly
09/11/21, 5:32 pm - +91 99721 79093: 2 years bro , not 1
09/11/21, 5:32 pm - +91 97396 15111: 25Lakhs if you are looking for a university biggest mistake that many of us make and even I made
09/11/21, 5:32 pm - +91 97396 15111: You need to look for colleges with co-op
09/11/21, 5:33 pm - +91 99721 79093: It's 12500 CAD dollars per years
09/11/21, 5:33 pm - +91 97396 15111: Universities are expensive plus getting a job after that is difficult because you are not industry ready
09/11/21, 5:34 pm - +91 99721 79093: And 50k indian rupees to sustain every month in canada
09/11/21, 5:34 pm - +91 99721 79093: I have friend in canada got these actual numbers from her
09/11/21, 5:34 pm - +91 97396 15111: I have many of my friends who have gone to Canada and have studied in colleges with co-op (this has the biggest advantage) and colleges will cost you around 12Lakhs for the entire course
09/11/21, 5:34 pm - +91 89715 68712: This is interesting. Actually I was checking about PNP, from india how can we get the opportunity like job in Canada? Ofcourse without a work permit. Company won't give us job na.
09/11/21, 5:35 pm - +91 97396 15111: Co op is internship after your course
09/11/21, 5:35 pm - +91 97396 15111: That adds as an experience in Canada
09/11/21, 5:35 pm - +91 89715 68712: Wow.
09/11/21, 5:35 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm
09/11/21, 5:36 pm - +91 99721 79093: Can you please name some colleges if you are aware?
09/11/21, 5:36 pm - +91 97396 15111: There is Centinel , conestoga and many others
09/11/21, 5:36 pm - +91 99721 79093: Is the course in the college for 1 year or 2?
09/11/21, 5:37 pm - +91 97396 15111: There are various kinds of course 1 year or 2 year
09/11/21, 5:37 pm - +91 97396 15111: I would go for a 1 year with Co op
09/11/21, 5:37 pm - +91 97396 15111: And I would not stick only to Canada
09/11/21, 5:37 pm - +91 99721 79093: The 12 lakhs which you was for 1 year right?
09/11/21, 5:38 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yeah with co op
09/11/21, 5:38 pm - +91 99721 79093: But for 1 year it's 1+1 year work permit right
09/11/21, 5:38 pm - +91 97396 15111: No now they give you 2 years of WP
09/11/21, 5:38 pm - +91 97396 15111: After 1 year course
09/11/21, 5:39 pm - +91 99721 79093: Ohh
09/11/21, 5:39 pm - +91 89715 68712: Study wise is actually very best.
09/11/21, 5:39 pm - +91 89715 68712: But how is this possible?
09/11/21, 5:39 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yeah I tried for Express entry my Crs score was 440
09/11/21, 5:40 pm - +91 97396 15111: But never got an invitation
09/11/21, 5:40 pm - +91 99721 79093: What was the recent cut off?
09/11/21, 5:40 pm - +91 97396 15111: The draw scores were 607 when I applied
09/11/21, 5:40 pm - +91 97396 15111: Not sure
09/11/21, 5:41 pm - +91 99721 79093: That's very high...üòû
09/11/21, 5:41 pm - +91 89715 68712: That was PNP right?
09/11/21, 5:41 pm - +91 97396 15111: No express entry
09/11/21, 5:41 pm - +91 97396 15111: PNP is fairly lower
09/11/21, 5:41 pm - +91 97396 15111: That‚Äôs why better chances of getting
09/11/21, 5:41 pm - +91 99721 79093: And due to covid right they have a lot of international applicants who are not processed
09/11/21, 5:42 pm - +91 97396 15111: Plus if your working then your recent studies should be related
09/11/21, 5:42 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yes
09/11/21, 5:42 pm - +91 97396 15111: Eg you are A software Engineer then you should have studied a computer related course in your bachelors or masters
09/11/21, 5:43 pm - +91 99721 79093: But the only thing about PNP is you get to work only in that province
09/11/21, 5:43 pm - +91 89715 68712: @919739615111 your in data science field? Like how many yrs experience you have?
09/11/21, 5:43 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yes you need work there for a couple of years
09/11/21, 5:44 pm - +91 97396 15111: I‚Äôm tester by profession with 7 years of experience
09/11/21, 5:44 pm - +91 97396 15111: And I studied B.E in biomedical engineering
09/11/21, 5:45 pm - +91 97396 15111: I needed to align my job with my studies
09/11/21, 5:45 pm - +91 89715 68712: Oh that's nice. So you tried PNP right? What happened to that?
09/11/21, 5:45 pm - +91 70734 10928: What are the eligibility for this ? And are you in cs field or any other ?
09/11/21, 5:45 pm - +91 97396 15111: No did not try PNP because I did not want to work in the same province for 2 or 4 years
09/11/21, 5:46 pm - +91 97396 15111: PNP will give you a PR not a job
09/11/21, 5:46 pm - +91 97396 15111: So if you do not get a job that you want in that province you are stuck there till you complete 2 or 4 years to get citizenship
09/11/21, 5:47 pm - +91 97396 15111: It‚Äôs only after you get citizenship that you can work in a different province if applied through PNP
09/11/21, 5:47 pm - +91 99721 79093: That's a big risk
09/11/21, 5:47 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yeah that‚Äôs why studying is the best option
09/11/21, 5:48 pm - +91 97396 15111: Plus ML and AI is rare skill in market at the moment even abroad
09/11/21, 5:48 pm - +91 99721 79093: Bcoz most of the jobs are in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.
Other places in canada has very less jobs
09/11/21, 5:48 pm - +91 97396 15111: So higher chances of getting a job of you have the skill
09/11/21, 5:48 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yes exactly
09/11/21, 5:48 pm - +91 97396 15111: That‚Äôs why don‚Äôt stick only to Canada
09/11/21, 5:49 pm - +91 97396 15111: If you take studying as an option
09/11/21, 5:49 pm - +91 99721 79093: Exactly
09/11/21, 5:49 pm - +91 99721 79093: That's where the vitamin M comes into the picture.
09/11/21, 5:49 pm - +91 99721 79093: Do you know what's vitamin M?
09/11/21, 5:50 pm - +91 89715 68712: Money üòÇ
09/11/21, 5:50 pm - +91 97396 15111: üòÇ

09/11/21, 5:50 pm - +91 99721 79093: You got it
09/11/21, 5:51 pm - +91 89715 68712: For me vitamin M is my mom. So I cannot leave her alone and go to abroad, so that's the reason trying for Canada Express entry so I can take her too üòä
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 97396 15111: Good you can apply for companies which sponsor ppl from out
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 97396 15111: Try doing a research in companies in Canada that sponsor
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 99721 79093: So plan is simple, finish this course. Get a higher paying job here. Save up as much as   vitamin M and go to Canada
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 99721 79093: üëçüèª
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yeah but age is also a factor
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 89715 68712: Are there any particular for jobs which are open for immigrants ?
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 97396 15111: You get older your scores reduce
09/11/21, 5:52 pm - +91 89715 68712: I am 25 so that's ok.
09/11/21, 5:53 pm - +91 97396 15111: Haha lucky you
09/11/21, 5:53 pm - +91 99721 79093: Ya

09/11/21, 5:54 pm - +91 99721 79093: üòÅ
09/11/21, 5:54 pm - +91 89715 68712: I am working in mnc but prob is, my company don't have branch in canada. Only uk.
09/11/21, 5:54 pm - +91 99721 79093: Just wait till your mother talk about wanting a daughter in law. Things will change after that conversationüòÑ
09/11/21, 5:55 pm - +91 97396 15111: Ask them to send you to UK if it‚Äôs possible

09/11/21, 5:55 pm - +91 97396 15111: I was in UK until last year
09/11/21, 5:55 pm - +91 89715 68712: Oh. But still Canada is a immigrant place but not uk na.
09/11/21, 5:55 pm - +91 89715 68712: Dude, you covered canada, uk and what else? üòÖ
09/11/21, 5:55 pm - +91 97396 15111: And once you are there you wouldn‚Äôt want to come back üòÅ

09/11/21, 5:56 pm - +91 89715 68712: üòÇ but I don't they will send because it's a UK's top retail company.
09/11/21, 5:56 pm - +91 97396 15111: If you can stay in UK for 5 years in General visa you get a PR
09/11/21, 5:57 pm - +91 97396 15111: See there are so many ways to get PR we just need to find ways
09/11/21, 5:57 pm - +91 89715 68712: Ohh. How tough is to get Europe work permit or do job as a immigrant?
09/11/21, 5:57 pm - +91 97396 15111: So many insta pages telling job openings in companies abroad
09/11/21, 5:58 pm - +91 97396 15111: Europe there is a catch you need to know either Spanish , French or German or Dutch
09/11/21, 5:58 pm - +91 89715 68712: For me the only problem is, I cannot leave the job and study. üòÖ Apart from that, with the job, I am ok to do anything, I mean try any country.
09/11/21, 5:58 pm - +91 89715 68712: Ya. I head half of them are fake üòÇ, all the consultancy and stuff.
09/11/21, 5:59 pm - +91 99721 79093: Many people are in the same boat
09/11/21, 5:59 pm - +91 97396 15111: No don‚Äôt go with consultancy
09/11/21, 5:59 pm - +91 89715 68712: Hmmm ya that's there
09/11/21, 5:59 pm - +91 97396 15111: There are ppl who tell their own experience

09/11/21, 6:00 pm - +91 89715 68712: Hmmm. So overall, just using work we can move to countries, ideally education in the same country is not mandatory. üòÖ
09/11/21, 6:01 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yup
09/11/21, 6:02 pm - +91 89715 68712: Hmmm thanks a lot for the info bro. So why this course? For any particular country scores?
09/11/21, 6:03 pm - +91 97396 15111: I wanted to align my field of job with my education
09/11/21, 6:06 pm - +91 89715 68712: But you have so much experience na, does that matter now?
09/11/21, 6:09 pm - +91 88704 19945: Folks, these discussions are very valuable about PR. Even I am Canada PR 'aspirant'. But I feel this group is mainly for appliedroots course discussion. Other folks may feel we are spamming. However, I would request if we can create another group for this and people who are interested can join there.
09/11/21, 6:09 pm - +91 88640 27876: You guys are so visionary and talented, when I completed my graduation I had only two option either to continue with the same Company ( where I was placed) or to prepare for some exams, I never thought of going outside India.
09/11/21, 6:10 pm - +91 80083 60079: Nice idea, brother.
09/11/21, 6:10 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yeah still matters because they want quality labour and we are still ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù for them

09/11/21, 6:40 pm - +1 (610) 505-1068: Hi guys, do you guys recommend this diploma course or applied ai course. Which one do you think is more useful ? Any thoughts appreciated
09/11/21, 6:42 pm - +91 90357 92877: Content is mostly the same
Diploma is just in a structured semester manner and will you give you an official degree
09/11/21, 6:42 pm - +91 94373 11224: if someone is from non-tech background then Diploma will be better . Else if someone have a cs background then applied ai.
09/11/21, 6:43 pm - +91 94373 11224: That's what one of the mentors told me when i asked them the same question.
09/11/21, 6:44 pm - +91 78756 85040: Is Microphone mandatory for exam?
09/11/21, 6:44 pm - +91 97912 22474: There is difference in pattern. You have to solve 30 assignments in Aaic. In diploma, you have assignments, quizzes, mid term and semester end exams
09/11/21, 6:44 pm - +91 97912 22474: As they were explaining regarding the differences in q&a video, I guess the content is almost the same.
I think, the difference is that you will get an ugc certificate in diploma and it takes 1 year to complete.
Whereas, you can go at your own pace in Aaic and can try to complete the course quickly
09/11/21, 6:44 pm - +91 97912 22474: This is another difference

09/11/21, 8:30 pm - +91 77748 96465: Hi guys...I just answered a mock test...here are some of the key observation I made... questions aren't that difficult if u have gone through course videos properly...only 3-4 are tricky...but for other qstns be careful that u dnt make silly mistake...I made a few...and one more thing is be extremely careful about MSQ qstns....most of my incorrect answers are due to MSQs as I failed to tick all the correct options
09/11/21, 8:31 pm - +91 77748 96465: There are no partial marks awarded in MSQs
09/11/21, 8:32 pm - +91 94373 11224: thanks brother‚úåÔ∏è

09/11/21, 8:32 pm - +91 83418 08163: O..this has to be noted

09/11/21, 8:35 pm - +91 77748 96465: Even in simple qstns it's very easy to make silly mistakes...so take time and answer..don't rush..I felt 90min is alot of time to answer 30qstns...so adjust your time accordingly...I finished test in 60mins
09/11/21, 8:36 pm - +91 99721 79093: Same here
09/11/21, 8:37 pm - +91 99721 79093: But I am planning to use 60mins for 22-25 question and 30 mins for the last 5
09/11/21, 8:37 pm - +91 99721 79093: This might be a good strategy
09/11/21, 8:38 pm - +91 91131 88923: There should be option to revisit previously answered questions.
09/11/21, 8:39 pm - +91 99721 79093: We don't have it, need to live with what we have
09/11/21, 8:39 pm - +91 91131 88923: Even if we are not sure of answer we have to select any of the option.
09/11/21, 8:39 pm - +91 99721 79093: Yup
09/11/21, 8:40 pm - +91 91131 88923: How you guys are revising for mid term exam?
09/11/21, 8:44 pm - +91 95004 40196: What about the proportion of prepapatory content in mock test
09/11/21, 8:45 pm - +91 99116 67917: Thanks bro !! These are really life saver for me in last minutes.

09/11/21, 11:20 pm - +91 99721 79093: Yup
09/11/21, 11:39 pm - +91 89210 23935: How did you deal with SQL questions containing words like "referential integrity", "projection operation", "relational algebra" etc. in assignments and solved problems? Do you have prior SQL experience?
09/11/21, 11:39 pm - +91 77748 96465: Same qstn I have....these topics are not covered in course videos
09/11/21, 11:42 pm - +91 94882 02727: Most assignment questions are actually GATE practise questions. So, I guess they expect us to either guess the meaning of the words or go through the topic from other resources tooüòÖ
09/11/21, 11:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: I'm not even understanding the questions. And when seeing the questions I think how am I supposed to know all this.
09/11/21, 11:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: Is it necessary to know all these in order to apply SQL for data science?
09/11/21, 11:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: I'm okay will all other topics. With SQL I am feeling the disconnect
09/11/21, 11:44 pm - +91 94882 02727: Having source of topic knowledge as just Course videos might not be enough for most people. I come from CS background, and for me some words make sense, while some needs references
09/11/21, 11:45 pm - +91 97110 42979: w3 school or khan acdemy
09/11/21, 11:45 pm - +91 89210 23935: Khan academy has relational algebra?

10/11/21, 12:48 am - +91 99721 79093: Where did you find these topics arun,  is it in the additional questions?
10/11/21, 12:53 am - +91 89210 23935: No. It is in solved problems and assignments
10/11/21, 12:53 am - +91 89210 23935: Mandatory topics
10/11/21, 12:59 am - +91 99721 79093: Oh I get it after reading the explanation for the ight options
10/11/21, 12:59 am - +91 99721 79093: right *
10/11/21, 1:01 am - +91 99721 79093: The thing is know they have merged the Applied Gate Course (which has all these content) and the Diploma course topics for some topics
10/11/21, 1:01 am - +91 99721 79093: that's why these concepts are bouncing over the head.

10/11/21, 11:24 am - +91 84476 21501: For non cs studenta its difficult now
10/11/21, 11:24 am - +91 99721 79093: Exactly
10/11/21, 11:25 am - +91 70090 20949: Yeah it would be difficult for non CS students
10/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 88640 27876: The course duration should be 1.5 years for non CS
10/11/21, 11:27 am - +91 70090 20949: Really isn't it 1 year for everyone?
10/11/21, 11:29 am - +91 84476 21501: The topics covered in last 2 months are really hard and cant be digest in 1 time,its need more practice but for working professionals its difficult to give much time..and now there is exam üò≠

10/11/21, 12:48 pm - +91 78935 18350: There is no minimum mark in Mid term, but if we didn't attend it we are not eligible to take Semester end exam
10/11/21, 12:48 pm - +91 78935 18350: Minimum mark to pass*
10/11/21, 12:49 pm - +91 95732 60504: Thank you @917893518350
10/11/21, 12:49 pm - +91 90388 76605: As a whole I guess we have to get 40% and in each semester end exams
10/11/21, 12:49 pm - +91 88640 27876: Its better to fail then just passing
10/11/21, 12:50 pm - +91 95732 60504: why bro any logic here
10/11/21, 12:52 pm - +91 88640 27876: I think take your time to understand things, don't be in Hurry to just pasa
10/11/21, 12:52 pm - +91 88640 27876: *pass

10/11/21, 12:56 pm - +91 99721 79093: But their is a catch, what if you fail and your re-exam with the next batch overlaps by a day or two(max a week) with another exam of semester 2 (assuming advance machine learning). That will make things very hectic.
10/11/21, 12:57 pm - +91 88640 27876: No in that case do the samething for 2nd sem, I mean next sem will be your 1st sem and following sem will be 2nd sem
10/11/21, 12:58 pm - +91 88640 27876: It will take exactly 1.5  years

10/11/21, 12:58 pm - +91 88640 27876: You can then challenge CSE guys as well

10/11/21, 12:59 pm - +91 99721 79093: Flow in sense I mean the live sessions and placement assistance
10/11/21, 12:59 pm - +91 99721 79093: It will all be unsorted
10/11/21, 1:00 pm - +91 88640 27876: If you need placement then you should ask this question, that what is the minimum pass marks

10/11/21, 1:01 pm - +91 99721 79093: For placement I remember Srikanth sir mentioning 70-75% marks

10/11/21, 1:02 pm - +91 99721 79093: And they have used verbose to order the syntax
10/11/21, 1:02 pm - +91 89210 23935: I mean what does it match? All characters and underscores?
10/11/21, 1:02 pm - +91 89210 23935: Or dot and underscores?
10/11/21, 1:03 pm - +91 99721 79093: Not sure, need to revise this...

10/11/21, 1:08 pm - +91 94529 09216: All three characters
10/11/21, 1:09 pm - +91 77748 96465: \ is escape character I guess
10/11/21, 1:09 pm - +91 99721 79093: So it's a alphabetical word along with . or _ or / write?
10/11/21, 1:09 pm - +91 94529 09216: Not in character set
10/11/21, 1:09 pm - +91 70734 10928: Means dot will be read as dot by using front slash before this.
10/11/21, 1:09 pm - +91 77748 96465: Are u sure?
10/11/21, 1:10 pm - +91 94529 09216: Basically any character or metacharacter in [ ] lose their special meaning

10/11/21, 1:21 pm - +91 90388 76605: \ escape char ...so \. Means a dot should be present and _ means exactly one char
10/11/21, 1:24 pm - +91 92058 52308: _ is not a wild char it means underscore it self.
10/11/21, 1:24 pm - +91 92058 52308: That _ means one char is in SQL.

10/11/21, 7:04 pm - +91 93988 08159: Then I guess you have to wait for next batch to start and attempt exams with them paying some additional amount(just for the exam). If you really wish to skip, you need to confirm whether there would be a clash with any regular exam that you will attempt in your second semester
10/11/21, 7:05 pm - +91 88640 27876: No extra fees
10/11/21, 7:05 pm - +91 88640 27876: There will not be any clash
10/11/21, 7:06 pm - +91 93988 08159: Cool
10/11/21, 7:06 pm - +91 88640 27876: But take your own decision bro

10/11/21, 7:09 pm - +91 99877 12457: I think its doable üòÉ
10/11/21, 7:09 pm - +91 88844 76831: In the last session I asked sir if we are unable to clear this mid term then what's the way out... At that point in time sir said that there is no supplementary exams, we need to reappear for the mid term exam with the next batch...
10/11/21, 7:10 pm - +91 97890 35993: So in that case we can give sem exam
10/11/21, 7:10 pm - +91 88640 27876: Don't take too much stress man, life is very short
10/11/21, 7:10 pm - +91 97890 35993: Even if fail

And is there be anything in first.sem marksheet if we take the second attempt like low marks in first or something like that.
10/11/21, 7:38 pm - +91 91131 88923: You can't give second attempt for low marks

10/11/21, 7:40 pm - +91 91306 38007: 40% overall and 40% in semester end exam is the passing criteria, no mention of passing or fail for midterm exam.
10/11/21, 7:41 pm - +91 99721 79093: Any how they are gonna keep company specific exams during placements right.
10/11/21, 7:41 pm - +91 99721 79093: Like coding rounds and stuff...
So exam marks is not the end

10/11/21, 7:51 pm - +91 99116 67917: There should be 3.
10/11/21, 7:51 pm - +91 89210 23935: Weightage of this exam is like internal maks at college
10/11/21, 7:58 pm - +91 90357 92877: What is the logic of having the same syllabus for midterm exam and same syllabus for final examüòÖ
I think each midterm covers each module
Then there is one final exam for which syllabus is the complete semester

If someone can confirm that will be great
10/11/21, 7:59 pm - +91 97033 94349: Ahh that's why we are feeling it difficult to cover üòÖüòÖ end term syllabus for mid-term

10/11/21, 8:07 pm - +91 99116 67917: I don't think so, but if it is there, it will be nominal. As we can complete the whole Diploma in 2 years, so we won't be paying extra for the exams. -- As per my opinion

Where is it written that you have to individually pass the midterm separately? From what I understand you have to appear in the midterm exam to be eligible to write the end semester exam. That is what I can infer from the official Google docs. You just have to write the mid sem test now, doesn't matter even if you scored 0 in it, you are elegible to take the final exam and to pass the subject you have to score 40% in the finals(40% of 60) and an overall score of 40/100.
Now if they have had verbally said something else verbally to anyone, then bhai-saab that's totally fucked up! Whoever is maintaining those Google docs, speaks and writes lexically different English used in some other parallel universe.

10/11/21, 8:24 pm - +91 88704 19945: I would suggest folks to go through lectures and appear for mock test once. If mid term is gonna be on the same level as mock test, all of us can score more than 40%. More than 50% of the questions were easy questions
10/11/21, 8:25 pm - +91 88704 19945: So don't be scared folks. Discuss the topics which are difficult. People are ready to provide additional source and material here.
10/11/21, 8:25 pm - +91 90388 76605: Right

10/11/21, 8:35 pm - +91 99116 67917: Its just that they typed in so hurry they did mistakes in so many places, during posting email as alerts or FAQs

10/11/21, 8:43 pm - +91 95582 32982: Best strategy/rules for exam:

1.If you don't completed any topic please skip these topics. Concentrate on what you know and prepare for only those topics.

2. Give exam by assuming it's mandatory
No need to pass or fail just give for Fun

3. After exam learn remaining topics

10/11/21, 8:46 pm - +91 89715 68712: What is the submission deadline for assignments and quizzes?
You need to submit all the assignments for all courses in a semester by the day of the last semester-end exam for that semester. The date of the last semester-end exam is considered as the last day of the semester.
10/11/21, 8:46 pm - +91 89715 68712: See. Even the assignment are not Mandatory to be done within mid term
10/11/21, 8:47 pm - +91 89715 68712: Will the mid term and semester end exams be of the same difficulty as the mock tests?
Mock tests are created by us to help students better prepare for the exams. They are based on guidelines and on-campus exams that UoH conducts for similar courses. The actual exam questions are designed by the organizing committee of this program. Most likely, the actual exam questions would be of similar level of hardness as the mock tests. It may NOT be exactly the same level as-is. But, fairly similar. Sometimes, you may encounter easier questions and sometimes, little harder ones.

10/11/21, 8:48 pm - +91 89715 68712: What are the pass criteria for a course?
You need to obtain 40% marks in the overall course with 100 marks. You ALSO need to obtain 40% in the semester-end exam (60 marks). You will need to satisfy BOTH these criteria to pass in a course.
10/11/21, 8:48 pm - +91 89715 68712: So mid term does not have any criteria. Why people are creating false news lol. üôÑ

10/11/21, 9:51 pm - +91 99721 79093: What is the difference between N^c and C^n
10/11/21, 9:51 pm - +91 99721 79093: Log applied N times
10/11/21, 9:51 pm - +91 78756 85040: okay
10/11/21, 9:52 pm - +91 92058 52308: Like for loop.
10/11/21, 9:53 pm - +91 78756 85040: Got it
10/11/21, 9:53 pm - +91 92058 52308: One step iteration at a time.
10/11/21, 9:53 pm - +91 78756 85040: Lg(lg(lg ....n times
10/11/21, 9:54 pm - +91 99721 79093: Anyone? I have mess up polynomial with exponential
10/11/21, 9:54 pm - +91 99721 79093: Always*
10/11/21, 9:54 pm - +91 78756 85040: C^n is constant with variable exponent
10/11/21, 9:54 pm - +91 78756 85040: E.g
10/11/21, 9:54 pm - +91 78756 85040: 2^n
10/11/21, 9:55 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm and N can be anything
10/11/21, 9:56 pm - +91 78756 85040: And N¬≤ is special case of N^ c I guess
10/11/21, 9:56 pm - +91 77748 96465: N is the length of your input
10/11/21, 9:56 pm - +91 89210 23935: n^c means n¬≤ n¬≥ etc.. polynomial.

c^n means 2^n, 10^n etc.. which is exponential
10/11/21, 9:56 pm - +91 78756 85040: Exactly
10/11/21, 9:57 pm - +91 78756 85040: Polynomial and exponential are correct terms
10/11/21, 9:57 pm - +91 99721 79093: So basically 2 power 1000 is more that 1000 power 2, am I right?

10/11/21, 9:58 pm - +91 89210 23935: 1000 power 2 is just 1000000

2 power 10 itself is 1024. 2 power 1000 is very large number
10/11/21, 9:58 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm got it, now it makes sense
10/11/21, 10:33 pm - +91 99721 79093: How important do you people think matrix multiplication formula is? Bcoz to derive and calculate the values is taking me literally 10 mins, can't afford to use so much time in exam...
10/11/21, 10:33 pm - +91 99721 79093: Is it wise to skip it?
10/11/21, 11:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: If none of these is not an option, then I check the number of calculaton required for option A, B, C and D üòÖ
10/11/21, 11:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: Then selects the minimum
10/11/21, 11:24 pm - +91 99721 79093: Haha
10/11/21, 11:25 pm - +91 99721 79093: Must be most optimal right...
10/11/21, 11:25 pm - +91 99721 79093: So minimum is a good guess
10/11/21, 11:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: If *none of these* is not an option, it is not a guess. It is the answer
10/11/21, 11:26 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm
10/11/21, 11:27 pm - +91 99721 79093: I can't calculate fast...
10/11/21, 11:27 pm - +91 99721 79093: I am worried about time
10/11/21, 11:27 pm - +91 89210 23935: I can hehe
10/11/21, 11:27 pm - +91 99721 79093: Lucky you

10/11/21, 11:29 pm - +91 99721 79093: Hmm ya
10/11/21, 11:32 pm - +91 89210 23935: If the question is about order, this works. If it is asking the number of multiplications required, then I'm planning to skip or guess if it is taking too much time.

11/11/21, 1:29 am - +91 99116 67917: As per FAQ 30-60 min, it can take. So, don't close the chrome browser after finishing the test.

11/11/21, 11:38 am - +91 90388 76605: Even in Mock test -1 in programming question pow(x,n) if n==0 that program would return True
11/11/21, 11:39 am - +91 90388 76605: Yes it's true python interprets True as 1 but if user inputs (5,0) and gets a output True, it doesn't make sense
11/11/21, 11:42 am - +91 94529 09216: As per my understanding omega should be best time complexity, 
big O should be average 
and small should be worst
11/11/21, 11:42 am - +91 94529 09216: But after seeing above discussion I am also confused
11/11/21, 11:43 am - +91 90388 76605: Actually in most of the cases in internet you won't find best and worst cases in terms of small o or omega
11/11/21, 11:43 am - +91 73825 54571: Something pow 0 is 1.so it should return true right
11/11/21, 11:43 am - +91 90388 76605: In internet it's pretty simple...Big(o) worst, big theta average and big omega best
11/11/21, 11:44 am - +91 90388 76605: And small o and omega is loosely bounded so it's not considered...
11/11/21, 11:45 am - +91 90388 76605: It should return 1 actually. 5^0 is 1.
11/11/21, 11:45 am - +91 78756 85040: Like It should return integer type not Boolean one, right?
11/11/21, 11:46 am - +91 90388 76605: Right.
11/11/21, 11:47 am - +91 90388 76605: But what I understood is in exam if similar type of question comes...even if return True is present select that option üòÖ
11/11/21, 11:57 am - +91 78756 85040: Maybe they wanted to check whether one is aware of the fact that Boolean True is equivalent to 1üòÖ
11/11/21, 11:57 am - +91 78756 85040: But that output doesn't make sense
11/11/21, 11:57 am - +91 78756 85040: for sure
11/11/21, 11:57 am - +91 90388 76605: And then kept None of the above as a option üò¨

PS: i have completed only 70% of syllabus (no revision yet) and regression and dynamic programming is going over my head ‚Ä¶

Can you tell What topics need focus to score well?
11/11/21, 7:12 pm - +91 96505 18893: Basics of python especially dict, list, integer/float conversion
Maths functions differentiation 
Sql
Time complexity (easy one) mostly discussed in class
11/11/21, 7:13 pm - +91 96505 18893: What i understood if you see the videos carefully then also you can easily score 50%

Guys DON'T take those stupid FAQs seriously now(it seems they don't have general consensus regarding the guidelines, seriously who is behind those Google Docs). Always explicitely ask them everything over phone or better write directly to csk.varma@gmail.com.

12/11/21, 11:08 am - +65 8337 3637: It is stupid I know

12/11/21, 11:10 am - +65 8337 3637: My advise wud be
If it is not explicitly mentioned in the question
Dont use anything
12/11/21, 11:11 am - +91 97018 27354: What! That's so FFFDDD up!
12/11/21, 11:12 am - +91 75690 61914: Sir has conveyed clearly in the live session saying that, Google calculator or systems inbuilt calculator can be used only when it is mentioned in question itself other wise we shouldn't use them.
12/11/21, 11:15 am - +91 97018 27354: Thanks! I missed last 2 live sessions, was relying on the "Official docs". Forget calculator, I won't even use per or paper. God knows what will someone from UoH say after "Auditing" the vids.
12/11/21, 11:15 am - +65 8337 3637: Absolutely
My question to them was - it was more of a suggestion for them to have enable use of calculator in questions like that which requires calculations as we are not testing multiplication and div skills.
And their response was the above one
12/11/21, 11:29 am - +91 72045 68400: Hi ..

Mid term also do we get the exam results instantly? No right?

12/11/21, 11:41 am - +91 72045 68400: On the safer side, it's better not to use anything..

Just a pen and paper ...

Now another question I get is, during using pen or paper, should we adjust rhe camera so that they can see our desk and our pen/ paper too ..

Am sure by default they can see our face but not when we write something on a desk , haha

12/11/21, 11:45 am - +91 99721 79093: just use the local calculator to be on the safer side...
12/11/21, 12:06 pm - +91 97912 22474: So, should we just use our inbuilt calculator in the laptop
12/11/21, 12:09 pm - +91 88704 19945: Guys, keep calculator on the desk. Take advantage of online exams. People who appeared for exams in last 2 years have already taken so much advantage of this. Now, our time has come üòÇ

If you don't use pen and paper for hard problems involving mathematics, SQL and code dry runs, the chance of making mistakes (and silly mistakes) increases.

12/11/21, 2:32 pm - +91 90357 92877: Without going to the concept of recursion and dp this can be easily solved
12/11/21, 2:41 pm - +91 90357 92877: Try to find the worth of 1 unit of length for all the pieces

From the question it is clear that the 2cm length has a worth of 3.5 for each cm, and 3cm length has a worth of 3.66 for each cm
12/11/21, 2:41 pm - +91 90357 92877: So it is clear that 10cm rod has to be cut into pieces involving 3cm and 2cm
12/11/21, 2:42 pm - +91 90357 92877: The only solution is 3+3+2+2
12/11/21, 2:42 pm - +91 90357 92877: Trying to avoid dynamic programming as much as possibleüòÖ
12/11/21, 2:48 pm - +91 88510 78354: Thankyou
12/11/21, 2:52 pm - +91 97018 27354: 3-3-2-2, I won't get into DP if I am solving MCQs, plug n eliminate. 36 is max you can get.
12/11/21, 2:53 pm - +91 97018 27354: p(i) is not linear.
12/11/21, 2:59 pm - +91 90357 92877: Talking about the price for each cm for a piece, not the whole price itself

Eg.

1cm piece will pay you 1rs
2cm piece will pay you 7rs -> each cm worth 3.5rs
3cm piece will pay you 11-> each cm worth 3.66rs
4cm piece will pay you 12-> each cm worth 3rs
5cm piece will pay you 15 -> each cm worth 3rs
Similarly for others
12/11/21, 3:00 pm - +91 90357 92877: Clearly 2cm and 3cm pieces are more valuable....now need to use them to get 10cm
Which is 3+3+2+2
12/11/21, 3:04 pm - +91 78756 85040: Nice solution... converting to dp problem would be time consuming
12/11/21, 3:07 pm - +91 90357 92877: Yeah...could have tried DP if there was an option to revisit questions

But there is always a doubt regarding 'what if a tougher question is ahead' and cant afford to spend much time on one question

12/11/21, 3:11 pm - +91 97018 27354: p(i) is not a linear fn here. The moment you cut a 2cm piece into 2 1cm pieces the value goes down to 1+1 $. These statements are wrong -> 2cm piece will pay you 7rs -> each cm worth 3.5rs. Your soln. is correct but p(i) is defined as a discrete step fn.

13/11/21, 9:03 am - +91 94529 09216: But in list every item itself is a pointer, which is technically an address location. 
So 2 address of 2 should not be same as address of - (-2)
13/11/21, 9:04 am - +91 94529 09216: And is operator compares  address of value
13/11/21, 9:04 am - +91 94529 09216: *two values
13/11/21, 9:05 am - +91 94529 09216: This is true but
L1[0] is -L2[2] shouldn't be correct
13/11/21, 9:16 am - +91 77748 96465: L1 = L2  is given in qstns
13/11/21, 9:16 am - +91 77748 96465: So both lists are pointing to same object list
13/11/21, 9:17 am - +91 77748 96465: If L1 = L2 was not given...thn it wud have been false

That's the only issue I faced initially. Now Apple has released their tensorflow-metal plugin, things are great. I still prefer a linux box with Anaconda mainly because it takes care of GPUs.

13/11/21, 11:07 am - +91 70877 58526: I am using a avg spec laptop and since feature engineering and eda part doesn't require that much computation, one can do all of this on laptop and then save the preprocessed data. For model training, use colab or AWS sagemaker, I prefer sagemaker as it gets billed by the second and don't have to subscribe for a monthly charge. The models processing won't cost more than Rs 40-50 that too if you are really at it for experimenting.

Had to train 4 similar models for that assignment itself. So it took close to 1 week with colab timeouts.   In deep learning there are assignments that take even longer. Hope this course will be much easier.

Colab free tier has only 2vcpu with less than 13 gb ram

Now it's different, I think if someone wants to run experiments on a regular basis, dedicated machine would make more sense(~1 lakh). Let's see how much I can get done with colab/aws.

13/11/21, 2:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: RAM is often the problem. See if you can upgrade the ram. It is likely to have an additional slot for new ram.

M1 mac is very good. But I think eventually we need to use cloud services for huge workloads.

Having anaconda is nice, pip works but sometimes your break your env, anaconda takes care of all compatibility issuies for you. That's what I miss most in the new macs. Anyways you can avoid those by using venv or docker.

13/11/21, 3:14 pm - +91 97018 27354: Bhai upgrade kar le, 8 gb 3k me aa jaega, ssd 2k. 2 GB me to chrome bhi ro deta hai after 20 tabs.

13/11/21, 3:15 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ok I will do that
13/11/21, 3:16 pm - +91 89210 23935: If it doesn't work, you can always return on Amazon üòÖ

13/11/21, 3:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: Good
13/11/21, 3:18 pm - +91 93508 03638: Like was it very difficult?
13/11/21, 3:18 pm - +91 89210 23935: I got 23 questions right, 4 silly mistakes, 1 mistake which got clarification that my answer was right. Other were wrong. I find it easy than mandatory assignment
13/11/21, 3:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think people who are already familiar will not face any issues
13/11/21, 3:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: Exactly

13/11/21, 3:33 pm - +91 93988 08159: The question wasn't framed correctly
13/11/21, 3:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: Exactly
13/11/21, 3:34 pm - +91 89210 23935: It's just a mock test, so I didn't pursued
13/11/21, 3:36 pm - +91 93988 08159: yeah
13/11/21, 3:36 pm - +91 93988 08159: but our thought process is right

I'm already familiar with the basics of python so i skipped making them for now. Will add them today if I have time. You can duplicate it and add your own. If you add some good cards share here.
13/11/21, 3:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: Awesome üòéüëç

Not sure if we can add edit rights to lot of people in notion, so I am suggesting google docs.
13/11/21, 4:14 pm - +91 89210 23935: Or Google sheets
13/11/21, 4:14 pm - +91 94529 09216: Liked this initiative
13/11/21, 4:15 pm - +91 94529 09216: And even one more sheet for interview type questions
13/11/21, 4:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: I was just thinking let's switch to telegram channel. It is very much flexible, there are options like pinned message, poll etc

13/11/21, 4:22 pm - +91 89210 23935: I created it long time ago. Didn't posted in slack because I like slack.  It is better than whatsapp in my opinion, but people use whatsapp more
13/11/21, 4:24 pm - +91 88003 13691: Exactly.. we could use slack and telegram for polls and other things but whatsapp is more used .
So we could share the important notes or information here as well.

I don't think you should refresh the page. In such cases during exams, you need to call them

14/11/21, 12:35 am - +91 98432 25743: Yeah in the mock it is mentioned as the best than big O and THETA
14/11/21, 12:42 am - +91 96544 29444: Hi, I am not well prepared for the exam, so can anybody confirm if I miss tomorrow's exam then can I complete my semester 2 in this batch/cohort only and semester 1 in the next cohort?

14/11/21, 12:54 am - +91 89715 68712: Anyone have any material, so I can refer üòê
14/11/21, 1:01 am - +91 88003 13691: There is no obligation for psasing marks in mid term right?
14/11/21, 1:01 am - +91 88003 13691: It has to be attended only
14/11/21, 1:01 am - +91 88003 13691: ?
14/11/21, 1:02 am - Nithin: Ya you should attend it otherwise u can't give your semester end exam
14/11/21, 1:02 am - +91 88003 13691: Haa
14/11/21, 1:03 am - +91 88003 13691: But passing marks ka toh kuch nahi h naa
14/11/21, 1:03 am - Nithin: Sir said there is no passing or failing marks in midterm
14/11/21, 1:03 am - +91 88003 13691: Oh okayy
14/11/21, 1:03 am - +91 88003 13691: Thankss

14/11/21, 1:05 am - Nithin: How much u got
14/11/21, 1:06 am - +91 89210 23935: 23 right, some silly mistakes that I had to facepalm. And wrong answers
14/11/21, 1:06 am - +91 88003 13691: Thats pretty good
14/11/21, 1:06 am - Nithin: it's good score
14/11/21, 1:07 am - +91 89715 68712: Toppers.
14/11/21, 1:08 am - +91 97018 27354: You can finish, sem 2 n 2 subjects from sem 1 with this batch. You would have to give essentials of ai in next batch. But why? Just try your best or luck tomorrow you can score 12 easily tomorrow. Recover in end sem. Ultimately it's your choice. Don't bother with grades too much, life is much more.
14/11/21, 1:12 am - +91 89210 23935: 76 % is above average only üòÖ

14/11/21, 1:12 am - +91 88003 13691: Sorry to ask again..12 is an obligation ?
Like from 180?
14/11/21, 1:14 am - +91 88003 13691: Is b the correct answer?
14/11/21, 1:14 am - +91 97018 27354: Forget books or videos. In simple terms range is the set of all possible values the right hand side can take. Domain is the set of all possible values that you can plug in. Eg f(n) = x square. Domain - to + infinity, range compute rhs, x square is always +ve so its 0 to +infinity.

14/11/21, 1:15 am - +91 99599 32345: The list l is never fixed, elements are being added after each run so the loop will be never ending
14/11/21, 1:16 am - +91 88510 78354: Okayy
14/11/21, 1:16 am - +91 88510 78354: Thanks
14/11/21, 1:17 am - +91 97018 27354: Yes, I confirmed. Twice. Someone made üí© in FAQs.
14/11/21, 1:19 am - +91 99116 67917: Whenever we define any loop, there should always be an exit condition else the loop will be going on and on.

14/11/21, 11:24 am - +91 99721 79093: Same here! We can directly use these techniques in our day to day work life...
14/11/21, 11:28 am - +91 88510 78354: Eda is actually good 
But after EDA, we have high level stats and probability chapter

14/11/21, 12:42 pm - +91 95000 08014: Friends be mindful of MSQs
What types/formats of questions are in the exams?
You will have MCQs, where ONLY one of the four options is correct. You will have to choose the correct option to be awarded the marks for it. These questions would be tagged #mcq
You will have MSQs(Multi Select Questions) where multiple choices/options of the provided four options are correct. You need to select all of the correct options. There shall be no marks awarded for partially correct answers.  These questions would be tagged #msq to avoid any confusion.

There is no negative marking.
Each question is worth 1 mark.
14/11/21, 12:43 pm - +91 95000 08014: Also remember that you cannot go back to previous response at any point of time
14/11/21, 12:44 pm - +91 95000 08014: Be careful while selecting answers

14/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 88704 19945: Both small o and big O are for worst. And omega for best
14/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 96310 97922: Graphically,  can u explain how small o is above big O
14/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 88704 19945: That question must be wrong
14/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 95000 08014: But for small o for all c>0 there exists n0>0
14/11/21, 2:10 pm - +91 95000 08014: I take back my statement
14/11/21, 2:11 pm - +91 95000 08014: For sure omega is best among the three as it is on lower bound
14/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 95000 08014: Small o is between 0<=fn<gn, hence believe should be worst, whereas Big O lies between 0<=fn<=gn
14/11/21, 2:15 pm - +91 95000 08014: Means fn can be equal to gn hence need not be worst
14/11/21, 2:15 pm - +91 83329 81498: maybe its a typo. if 2 is small omega, that would be the best option.
14/11/21, 2:16 pm - +91 95000 08014: Yes
14/11/21, 2:16 pm - +91 95004 40196: Big oh. Can be represented as theta also. Coz of less than equal 

But , small oh will be worst only
14/11/21, 2:16 pm - +91 95000 08014: It also could be that pick right from given options
14/11/21, 2:19 pm - +91 95000 08014: Since mock tests are prepared by Applied roots and today's mid term by University we should expect questions to be correct
14/11/21, 2:20 pm - +91 95000 08014: If not we should note if there are any incorrect questions and mail to the applied roots for them to liaise with UoH
14/11/21, 2:23 pm - +91 88510 78354: Has anybody given mock on company‚Äôs laptop? 
Does it work fine?
14/11/21, 2:38 pm - +65 8337 3637: Correct. However I would advise not to take screenshots as they may infer that as part of cheating. Maybe note down the premise of the question
14/11/21, 2:39 pm - +91 97890 35993: Yes. I have given. And it works fine
14/11/21, 2:39 pm - +91 95000 08014: Totally with you, we should note the question number and the content in paper and share it with team, no screenshot sharing
14/11/21, 2:43 pm - +91 96310 97922: Yup it works .. screen sharing is similar to what u have in google meet
14/11/21, 2:43 pm - +91 96310 97922: Although its good to take a mock test on the same laptop
14/11/21, 2:55 pm - +91 88510 78354: Okayy thanks
14/11/21, 2:55 pm - +91 88510 78354: Okayy

14/11/21, 3:27 pm - +91 97396 15111: no they did noy

14/11/21, 3:28 pm - +91 77310 00298: hi guys i am loosing more marks in msq  is there any trick to avoid that...?
14/11/21, 3:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: I spent 14 mins on flattening list msq and clicked the wrong option üòÖ 0 marks
14/11/21, 3:29 pm - +91 97396 15111: i wish they gave partial marks for MSQ's

14/11/21, 3:29 pm - +91 97396 15111: thats the most tricky ones
14/11/21, 3:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think especially for Msq, use pen and paper and reconfirm. A special note to myself when there is "None of these" as an option
14/11/21, 3:30 pm - +91 99721 79093: I gave up and guessed the options and got it right :D

14/11/21, 3:41 pm - +91 89210 23935: I was unsure, but we can compare
14/11/21, 3:41 pm - +977 984-5864046: But in example video
14/11/21, 3:41 pm - +91 89210 23935: I have confusion with count operator in SQL
14/11/21, 3:41 pm - +977 984-5864046: They told we can't compare null
14/11/21, 3:41 pm - +91 95668 19500: In problem,we are excluding null value that's it
14/11/21, 3:42 pm - +65 8337 3637: Not sure about your question.. but always always start with inner query. Write your results in paper and plug them in the outer query

14/11/21, 3:44 pm - +91 78756 85040: Exactly
14/11/21, 3:44 pm - +65 8337 3637: The query in the question in my opinion is looking for string NULL
And not Null values
14/11/21, 3:44 pm - +91 99721 79093: ok got it!
14/11/21, 3:45 pm - +65 8337 3637: Although haven't tried this assignment so not sure the whole question

14/11/21, 3:55 pm - +65 8337 3637: Well something new to learn
14/11/21, 3:56 pm - +65 8337 3637: Not sure if this was fr me - gt 18 and 20

14/11/21, 4:43 pm - +91 96184 80572: My test did not even start until the camera worked. Not sure how you were able to access the mock test after this error. For me it worked only after setting a usb cam
14/11/21, 4:43 pm - +91 78756 85040: Did you enable camera and speaker before giving mock test?
14/11/21, 4:44 pm - +91 78756 85040: A pop up from browser

14/11/21, 7:47 pm - +91 83329 81498: I said "is this main test" out loud multiple times. So that if it was actually mock I'd have some proof that it was a genuine mistake. Big üß† strat

14/11/21, 7:54 pm - +91 81798 00919: Can we use Google colab

14/11/21, 8:10 pm - +91 93988 08159: I don‚Äôt think we can use it unless spefified‚Ä¶confirm with the team

14/11/21, 8:10 pm - +91 81798 00919: Last from 28th onwards we got hard programs

14/11/21, 8:54 pm - +91 99721 79093: Not even a single question came from Regex, multi processing, API and code walk through!!!
14/11/21, 8:54 pm - +91 90388 76605: Noes append other numbers in the list
14/11/21, 8:54 pm - +91 90388 76605: Will it matter? We will just take first 3 elements everytime
14/11/21, 8:54 pm - +91 99721 79093: I can't believe this...
14/11/21, 8:54 pm - +91 89210 23935: [2,3,8,1,....]

14/11/21, 9:01 pm - +91 89727 71985: Most of time python doesn't need brackets - like me those who came from java and cpp it's sometimes becomes very confusing
14/11/21, 9:02 pm - +91 83329 81498: yes python does not check for the whole condition once it sees true and or next to each other. it's called short circuiting

14/11/21, 9:55 pm - +91 75690 61914: So for you, these mid exams n assignment would be like piece of cake right?
14/11/21, 9:56 pm - +91 99116 67917: Any tips or tricks for newbies like to me crack Data Scientist roles at fresher level?
14/11/21, 9:57 pm - +91 99998 58727: Marks and understanding are two different things.
As I‚Äôm from non cs background so most of the things were new to me and some were known
14/11/21, 9:57 pm - +91 72648 49874: Stary woth business analytics roles and move over to data science. That's rewarding. Else if you are able to learn from AppliedAiCourse then surely you'll crack many interviews.
14/11/21, 9:58 pm - +91 72648 49874: Absolutely right. Thanks for connecting.
14/11/21, 9:58 pm - Nithin: I graduated in 2019 and I don't have any work experience so how can I work to fill these gaps  and I'm taking this course as full time please suggest me
14/11/21, 9:58 pm - +91 99998 58727: Let‚Äôs do one informal session on some weekend
14/11/21, 9:58 pm - +91 72648 49874: Internships. Freelancing. Kaggle.

14/11/21, 9:59 pm - Nithin: Can I get ur LinkedIn adress
14/11/21, 9:59 pm - +91 72648 49874: Bottom line is you'll need a portfolio of projects. Interviews would look for problem solving experience. At least I would.
14/11/21, 9:59 pm - +91 99998 58727: I can share my recent interview experience, learnings, tips & tricks ‚úåüèª
14/11/21, 10:00 pm - Nithin: Ok
14/11/21, 10:00 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yes I totally agree to this
14/11/21, 10:00 pm - +91 99116 67917: During the Data Scientist interview how much DSA is asked or is it even considered to be the breaking point if we are not so great in it?
14/11/21, 10:02 pm - +91 99998 58727: Not that much
14/11/21, 10:02 pm - +91 99116 67917: Great to hear that.
14/11/21, 10:02 pm - +91 72648 49874: Not that much.
14/11/21, 10:02 pm - +91 78935 18350: If it's product based, it's mandatory for every role. For remaining company, not at all required
14/11/21, 10:02 pm - +91 78935 18350: For remaining companies*
14/11/21, 10:02 pm - +91 72648 49874: Main thing is to solve problems with whatever you know.
14/11/21, 10:03 pm - +91 99208 18609: For me, in all my interviews easy to medium DSA questions were askedüòì
14/11/21, 10:04 pm - +91 77748 96465: Anyone here is able to write optimised code for leetcode prblm?
I am able to solve using brute force only at this point

14/11/21, 10:07 pm - +91 72648 49874: Use Colab
14/11/21, 10:07 pm - +91 97688 02223: ‚úãüèª I'm interested.
But I'm a total beginner, don't even properly know basics yet
14/11/21, 10:07 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yes for this course it is not required as Sir also mentioned
14/11/21, 10:07 pm - +91 99208 18609: I use Colab for most of the heavy lifting. And for small datasets/POCs any laptop would work fine
14/11/21, 10:08 pm - +91 99208 18609: No mostly dictionaries and lists
14/11/21, 10:08 pm - +91 99998 58727: You have colab, kaggle
14/11/21, 10:08 pm - +91 88003 13691: This is really great . We could really use some guidance specially in projects and freelance stuff.
14/11/21, 10:08 pm - +91 99116 67917: I am interested

I have almost 5 years of experience in publishing and 3 years of experience in teaching in Switzerland. My forte is Mathematics and Computer Science school books editing. 
However recently realised editing is not my passion and wants to get back to programming. Hence I joined this course. Currently I am looking for some job in IT so that it will help me with my placement after this course. Since I know many people here are from IT industry let me know if anyone knows about some job/internship opportunities? Please DM me
15/11/21, 8:04 am - +91 88988 90243: Please share your CV
15/11/21, 8:30 am - +91 99998 58727: You can probably share your publishing experience with us. I would be really interested to know how to publish books.
15/11/21, 8:33 am - +91 96505 18893: I work only on maths and computer science school books (like RD sharma, oxford new mathematics) ‚Ä¶ it is different from fictional/non fictional books.

15/11/21, 2:07 pm - +91 89715 68712: Wow. There are lot of content added, I mean compared to the Applied AI course.
15/11/21, 2:07 pm - +91 88640 27876: 2nd Module seems easier for me
15/11/21, 2:07 pm - +91 77748 96465: Practice...no easy way
Thats wat sir told in live session
15/11/21, 2:08 pm - +91 88640 27876: In First Module this dynamic programming was completely new to me
15/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 84476 21501: Yes practice but ai course itself has much to cover,couldnt get enough time for practice
15/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 77748 96465: Have u done applied AI?
15/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 84476 21501: Specially working professional

15/11/21, 2:11 pm - +91 88640 27876: For working professional, it not possible to complete with revision and practice
15/11/21, 2:11 pm - +91 88640 27876: Becoz we have deliverables here also
15/11/21, 2:11 pm - +91 88640 27876: Sometimes working in night also

15/11/21, 2:13 pm - +91 88640 27876: They told ok, take your time
15/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 99599 32345: Forgot about programming for some time, When you see any problem take a pen and paper and try to solve it step by step in normal manner. Once you have solution, using the basic programming functions,loops etc.., try to code   for each step which you have solved in paper. The code may not work as expected, debug what each line is doing using print statements and fix it. This may take lot of time initially but gradually you will become good at it
15/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 88640 27876: 100% agreed
15/11/21, 2:17 pm - +91 84476 21501: Agree ,but problem is patience and time,if no choice,then will push myself to give more time on this
15/11/21, 2:17 pm - +91 88640 27876: But if you are devoting 7 hr on Saturday and Sunday, then you can complete with practice as well as revision
15/11/21, 2:19 pm - +91 83340 60156: Same for me as well..I was in a recording session,ask the client to take a break and  finished it within 10mins

Start practicing easy problems on leet code. After solving some easy level problems on leet code, you will gain some confidence. Then, you can start doing medium level questions.
15/11/21, 3:45 pm - +91 90388 76605: No bro..they didn't reply yet
15/11/21, 3:56 pm - +65 8337 3637: The CA certificate is now no longer available
They have changed it to Tableau Certified Data Analyst. Also it is now not an open book exam. No internet access and no Tableau tool access for theoretical questions.

15/11/21, 4:54 pm - +91 88704 19945: Assignments I did during the week between last lecture and mid term. Because there were no videos to watch. So had time to do assignments

This idea seems great actually
15/11/21, 4:58 pm - +91 99721 79093: We have to take leaves, or else it will be very difficult to manage

15/11/21, 4:58 pm - +91 88704 19945: Exactly. I keep skipping those parts . I usually finish live lectures in half an hour. üòÇ

When it comes about vouching for a person (technically and not personally) we don't have to worry as we all are doing the same course and we know how extensive it is. So people having any leads or referrals to jobs kindly share *if everybody is okay with this.*

What are the pass criteria for a course?
You need to obtain 40% marks in the overall course with 100 marks. You ALSO need to obtain 40% in the semester-end exam (60 marks). You will need to satisfy BOTH these criteria to pass in a course.

17/11/21, 11:23 am - +91 72596 94754: This is actually continuous except at 3
17/11/21, 11:23 am - +91 89727 71985: I also have the same question

17/11/21, 11:24 am - +91 94529 09216: Without continuous how it can be differentiable
17/11/21, 11:25 am - +91 89210 23935: I wrote none of these üòÖ
17/11/21, 11:25 am - +91 81445 54148: Where we can see the test  section in website
17/11/21, 11:25 am - +91 89500 87417: I got 14
17/11/21, 11:25 am - +91 87449 23207: ok
17/11/21, 11:25 am - +91 78756 85040: They have said it's continuous
17/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 78756 85040: But option is wrong
17/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 72596 94754: Yeah
17/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 90071 50601: It's option b, has to be.
17/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 72596 94754: I agree
17/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 78756 85040: Exactly
17/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 94529 09216: Are we will get 1 more marks üéâ
17/11/21, 11:26 am - +91 89210 23935: That's what I thought. On googling..

In particular, any differentiable function must be continuous at every point in its *domain*.

X=3 is not in it's domain
17/11/21, 11:27 am - +91 78756 85040: And i interpreted differentiable in general sense
17/11/21, 11:27 am - +91 78756 85040: Yeah
17/11/21, 11:27 am - +91 78756 85040: It's not differentiable in general
17/11/21, 11:28 am - +91 88988 90243: 17,21,21

17/11/21, 11:28 am - +91 89210 23935: My silly mistakes decreased, actual mistakes increased
17/11/21, 11:28 am - +91 99998 58727: I got 23
17/11/21, 11:28 am - +91 94529 09216: Only silly mistake, I just can't even tell you guys,2 questions I solved correctly but marked it wrong üò≠

17/11/21, 11:35 am - +65 8337 3637: I am of the opinion ki it should have been more hands-on.

For e.g. order of precedence of AND / OR is not useful in this age of google and SO..
But my opinion

It shud have been hands on, open book, 30 questions 45 mins maybe.
17/11/21, 11:35 am - +91 89210 23935: I think highest will be 28 or above
17/11/21, 11:36 am - +91 99998 58727: Brother we have approximately 500 people in our batch and we are 198 here less than 50% 

So can‚Äôt deduce that üòÑ

17/11/21, 11:38 am - +91 87008 71097: Is this solution correct?
17/11/21, 11:38 am - +91 87008 71097: It should be continuous right ?
17/11/21, 11:38 am - +91 94529 09216: Yes
17/11/21, 11:39 am - +91 88640 27876: It is continuous but not differentiable

17/11/21, 11:39 am - +91 87008 71097: Right

17/11/21, 11:39 am - +65 8337 3637: Mene to None mark kiya tha toh baaki k log lad lijye üòÉ
17/11/21, 11:41 am - +91 94529 09216: While solving this question , I had a doubt, I mean it is not differentiable only at 3, so in general what will say 
fx is continuous or discontinuous?
17/11/21, 11:41 am - +91 94529 09216: *sorry differentiable or non diff
17/11/21, 11:42 am - +91 78756 85040: F(x) is continuous
17/11/21, 11:42 am - +91 87008 71097: No differentiable
17/11/21, 11:42 am - +91 94529 09216: That was a typo
17/11/21, 11:42 am - +91 78756 85040: Though not differentiable
17/11/21, 11:42 am - +91 94529 09216: Oh
17/11/21, 11:43 am - +91 99850 33894: Mid term exam results are out

17/11/21, 11:43 am - +91 99850 33894: Yaa
17/11/21, 11:43 am - +91 94529 09216: But differentiability is calculated on a point na?
17/11/21, 11:44 am - +91 94529 09216: ü§£ü§£
17/11/21, 11:44 am - +91 88640 27876: There is shortcut to it, just draw tangent at 3 from both left and right of 3 , if you get same tangent then it is differentiable or non differentiable
17/11/21, 11:44 am - +91 78756 85040: Should we take poll on it?
17/11/21, 11:44 am - +91 80138 23518: I got 17 .... Looks like less than Mean üòê
17/11/21, 11:45 am - +91 90357 92877: What is the zoom call about?
17/11/21, 11:46 am - +91 80138 23518: Many correct answers were not useful bcz of MSQ üòìüòì
17/11/21, 11:46 am - +91 78756 85040: @918800313691 What is it about?
17/11/21, 11:46 am - +91 83329 81498: guys, i think their answer is right. 
it is similar to relu/hinge loss which is also differentiable everywhere except one place. 
but they are still widely used. 
once read this: https://www.quora.com/Why-does-ReLU-work-with-backprops-if-its-non-differentiable
17/11/21, 11:47 am - +91 78756 85040: But in context of mathematics Just search about differentiability of Modulus function
17/11/21, 11:48 am - +91 83329 81498: yeah thats confusing me as well. even I chose none of the above
17/11/21, 11:48 am - +91 82498 79270: It will be continuous bt not differentiable
17/11/21, 11:49 am - +91 99998 58727: Has anyone mailed the team regarding this?
17/11/21, 11:49 am - +91 73825 54571: Y
17/11/21, 11:49 am - +91 87449 23207: yup
17/11/21, 11:49 am - +91 94529 09216: I have read this function in context of machine learning n number of times, but I could never understand this , why to learn .
But now after learning basic calculus, surely I will get thise things.
17/11/21, 11:50 am - +91 90388 76605: 19-21-22üòÇ
17/11/21, 11:50 am - +91 78756 85040: Then the option should be f(x) is differentiable except at x = 3
17/11/21, 11:51 am - +91 94529 09216: So maturity is realising you are nothing without BASICS.
17/11/21, 11:51 am - +91 89210 23935: Except X=3 it is diffentiable, so I think their option is correct by the definition of differentiability.
17/11/21, 11:51 am - +91 78756 85040: üìà
17/11/21, 11:51 am - +91 94529 09216: That's what I was asking

17/11/21, 11:51 am - +91 83329 81498: yes. hinge loss is used in SVMs and relu is used in MLPs
17/11/21, 11:51 am - +91 94529 09216: Ha
17/11/21, 11:52 am - +91 78756 85040: It should be differentiable every where
17/11/21, 11:52 am - +91 99116 67917: Are we having ZOOM call?
17/11/21, 11:52 am - +91 78756 85040: Then we can say f(x) is differentiable

17/11/21, 12:25 pm - +91 90388 76605: Btw except one guy have anyone else received ID card?
17/11/21, 12:25 pm - +91 78756 85040: Nope
17/11/21, 12:25 pm - +91 99165 48094: I received it yesterday evening
17/11/21, 12:26 pm - +91 90388 76605: Okay 2 den üòÖ

17/11/21, 12:28 pm - +91 78756 85040: Miracle
17/11/21, 12:29 pm - +65 8337 3637: I got it last night as well

17/11/21, 12:29 pm - +91 78756 85040: Maybe
17/11/21, 12:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ye jitne applied ai course Wale h, in sabko last me I'd card milega
17/11/21, 12:30 pm - +91 98954 87437: I received today .20 minutes back .
17/11/21, 12:35 pm - +91 88510 78354: I got 19 :/
17/11/21, 12:37 pm - +91 96505 18893: üëèüèªüëèüèª
17/11/21, 12:37 pm - +91 70877 58526: Same. I hate this no going back to previous question thing. As I know I can't re-visit a question I spend up more time in looking for ways of solving them. I thought 90 min is too much time but I ended up not being able to reach last few questions. I missed attempting the last question by a second. I had the answer and now I see it was the right answer, I just didn't have the time.
17/11/21, 12:39 pm - +91 88510 78354: Greatt
17/11/21, 12:39 pm - +91 88510 78354: Got it
17/11/21, 12:41 pm - +91 89210 23935: Not able to revisit tricky questions later and having randomisation decide the order of tricky questions is a pain. It's like if you are no sure, waste time on it or lose the marks
17/11/21, 12:42 pm - +91 70877 58526: Exactly.
17/11/21, 12:44 pm - +91 83340 60156: Do we have to go to the test link in order to find the result??
17/11/21, 12:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes. Click on summary
17/11/21, 12:44 pm - +91 83340 60156: Thanks

17/11/21, 12:49 pm - +91 94529 09216: I am working a table which has different columns including one column which contains rows of date . But the problem is , there is 3 different date format in a single column, and I have to query between two dates. Can anyone suggest me how to solve that
17/11/21, 12:50 pm - +91 88988 90243: Python?
17/11/21, 12:50 pm - +91 94529 09216: Sql
17/11/21, 12:50 pm - +91 88988 90243: You can convert all columns to same date format first
17/11/21, 12:50 pm - +91 94529 09216: To_date?
17/11/21, 12:50 pm - +91 88988 90243: Okay
17/11/21, 12:50 pm - +91 94529 09216: Na
17/11/21, 12:51 pm - +91 88988 90243: Is there any pattern in all those 3 format in single column
Eg length of date
17/11/21, 12:51 pm - +91 95668 19500: Same here...
17/11/21, 12:52 pm - +91 94529 09216: <Media omitted>
17/11/21, 12:52 pm - +91 94529 09216: No
17/11/21, 12:53 pm - +91 94529 09216: Whenever I am using to_date, it throws an error, string literal don't match
17/11/21, 12:53 pm - +91 88988 90243: Yes
17/11/21, 12:53 pm - +91 94529 09216: Because to_date will only work if all are of same format
17/11/21, 12:54 pm - +91 88988 90243: In my opinion you need to do it by putting conditions

If the column contains (jan feb August then replace it with (01, 02,08)
17/11/21, 12:55 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ok I will see
17/11/21, 12:56 pm - +91 88510 78354: Relative marking hai na?
And highest 24 hai?
17/11/21, 12:58 pm - +91 96505 18893: Thanks Divyansh

17/11/21, 1:00 pm - +91 88510 78354: Yes
17/11/21, 1:01 pm - +91 95370 26661: I think everyone will get plus one (jisne continuous choose kiya hai)
17/11/21, 1:01 pm - +91 88510 78354: I guess?

17/11/21, 1:05 pm - +91 89210 23935: You have to import numpy as np also.
17/11/21, 1:05 pm - +91 88510 78354: Okayy
17/11/21, 1:06 pm - +91 81445 54148: Yes
17/11/21, 1:06 pm - +91 81445 54148: Which is not in option
17/11/21, 1:06 pm - +91 81445 54148: And pseudocode
17/11/21, 1:06 pm - +91 98933 88933: I got 25 üòÖ

17/11/21, 1:08 pm - +91 89210 23935: Deep leaning modules right now
17/11/21, 1:08 pm - +91 91101 22836: Itne marks me 2 log pass ho jayengeüòÜ
17/11/21, 1:09 pm - +91 98933 88933: haha, although honestly I don't think marks will matter that much, in the end it'll be your knowledge and portfolio that'll matter
17/11/21, 1:10 pm - +65 8337 3637: üëç
17/11/21, 1:10 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yup! Eventho some options might be wrong, the concepts are right
17/11/21, 1:10 pm - +91 85408 08934: Bs kr bhai kidney may heartattack aa jayega
17/11/21, 1:10 pm - +91 98933 88933: While in Applied AI Course, I gave interviews for 3-4 companies, the ML part was on easy-moderate side, I lacked on the coding ground
17/11/21, 1:11 pm - +91 98933 88933: Although from cs background and worked as software engineer for 2 yrs
17/11/21, 1:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: Honestly I'm not very good at coding
17/11/21, 1:12 pm - +91 89210 23935: They might have asked hard questions because of the same reason
17/11/21, 1:13 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes maybe recursion and dp problems are very common
17/11/21, 1:15 pm - +91 91825 70417: I got 23

17/11/21, 1:33 pm - +91 90388 76605: We need to practice a lot...but it's also hard..while working and completing the syllabus..

17/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 95370 26661: For example if you have created a simple bar chart of the patients who survived and not. Just write your analysis below that. And do that for every type of chart you prepare @919038876605

17/11/21, 2:16 pm - +91 77310 00298: OK then they add a mark right
17/11/21, 2:16 pm - +91 95370 26661: We'll get to know soon. They are looking into it.
17/11/21, 2:17 pm - +91 98209 18938: How to chk result
17/11/21, 2:21 pm - +91 91512 22368: I Got 17, with no preparation at all. Ok feeling with my performance. Never been a Good with marks üòÑüòÉ.
17/11/21, 2:24 pm - +91 98432 25743: If u give next without selecting any options the question will be un answered..!
17/11/21, 2:25 pm - +91 98432 25743: I made that mistake for 2 questions..!
17/11/21, 2:26 pm - +91 80138 23518: Exact same marks bro... I had covid and decided to opt out of the exam... Mailed them but they still asked me to sit for the exam with whatever I was prepared wd... Also so that I can appear in the semester end exam so had to sit for this one without not much preparation
17/11/21, 2:27 pm - +91 91512 22368: If u haven't  given any competitive exam recently u  r  bound to make this mistake, take any quiz/mock before going next time. It's just getting being used too.
17/11/21, 2:32 pm - +91 98432 25743: Yeah..!
17/11/21, 2:32 pm - +91 98859 04893: For me, it was one week of time, for course videos, assignments.. all in one week, because if my project deadlines. Started from 6th-13th course. I attended live session, but will not help much if topics are not completed..I know it's bad practice, I am happy to see you guys..it's motivating..will try to catch you up
17/11/21, 2:33 pm - +91 77748 96465: What I feel is...doing assignments and projects brilliantly is worth more than exam marks
Many might have different opinion
17/11/21, 2:33 pm - +91 80138 23518: I second u.... Absolutely right
17/11/21, 2:34 pm - +91 77748 96465: Finally in interview companies won't ask mcqsüòÖ
17/11/21, 2:34 pm - +91 80138 23518: Marks would be of no use till we understand things from first principals or conceptually
17/11/21, 2:34 pm - +91 77748 96465: üíØ
17/11/21, 2:35 pm - +91 80138 23518: **principles
17/11/21, 2:36 pm - +91 95000 08014: My view let us not negate the importance of marks. While it may not be important for experienced or working professional who are settled. For freshers and less experienced who are looking for placements, marks is important
17/11/21, 2:36 pm - +91 98209 18938: Where u guys chked marks

17/11/21, 2:40 pm - +91 84476 21501: Focus on next topic now üòÉ
17/11/21, 2:40 pm - +91 77748 96465: True...no point in ignoring marks...but it's very important to learn thing conceptually and apply it...rather than just running behind marks...
17/11/21, 2:40 pm - +91 90357 92877: Yeah Marks actually dont matter, but I remember Srikant sir saying that for placements, people with highest marks are given higher priority, thats the issue
17/11/21, 2:42 pm - +91 77748 96465: We better clear this point in live session...because less marks don't necessarily mean poor knowledge....ppl are prone to make silly mistakes in objective exams
17/11/21, 2:42 pm - +91 77748 96465: I wish we had exams where we had to write code and apply the concept whch we learnt
17/11/21, 2:43 pm - +91 80138 23518: Can't agree more
17/11/21, 2:43 pm - +91 80138 23518: Well said
17/11/21, 2:43 pm - +91 84476 21501: I think its fine,we will have one more mid term before semester exam,so lets do more for 2nd mid term and semester1,whatever we got in 1st mid term,its still ok..mostly non cs guys dint get well and can recover in other topics
17/11/21, 2:44 pm - +91 84476 21501: Both marks and knowledge important at their place ,so lets go for next one üòÉ
17/11/21, 2:44 pm - +91 91512 22368: For me Mark's are just a marker to know where u stand in the group and where u need to work upon. Knowledge is something u have to self content with, so we get best of both to judge yourself.
17/11/21, 2:45 pm - +91 77748 96465: Yes ..let's focus on course 2 nowüòÅ

17/11/21, 6:20 pm - +91 97018 27354: Not worth it.
17/11/21, 6:20 pm - +91 97018 27354: There are plenty of free resources.

17/11/21, 6:24 pm - +91 97018 27354: In you are from non CS then,  use Exercism and write as many small programs as you can. I mean make it ha habit, watch sendex.
17/11/21, 6:25 pm - +91 98933 88933: I've also done the interview prep course by aaic (predecessor to applied coding track), the course is very good and detailed, both theoritically and practice problems wise, so not doubt on the course quality, as far as I'm concerned, I learn faster and better through audio/video lectures as compared to books/online articles, if it's the same for you then  course is good

Having said that, the course requires full time effort and it'll be very tough to handle it along diploma course

My suggestion would be to complete diploma first and then take this course
17/11/21, 6:34 pm - +91 97018 27354: Every one has their learning style, I totally agree with that. But goin fwd in your career you want to become a person who can quickly read docs and deliver.
17/11/21, 6:35 pm - +91 98933 88933: Correct that's the ideal and faster way
17/11/21, 6:35 pm - +1 (514) 974-0682: I agree ..lets focus on diploma for a now.

In our case dot of w and that point cordinates 
Like p1.w = -2.1 +1.1 =-ve
So p1 lies opposite direction to normal of plane.
Likewise we check for all points.

17/11/21, 10:38 pm - +91 95370 26661: The marks are updated then I guess. Sab check karlo. Mera ekk mark badh gaya hai.
17/11/21, 10:38 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yeah but you selected continuous and they marked it wrong for you but for me they have mentioned continuous is correct
17/11/21, 10:39 pm - +91 95370 26661: You might have checked it recently that is why.

17/11/21, 10:42 pm - +91 90529 47300: Any one got update on SQL distinct question? Solution shows '2' as correct one but I think it's 1. Null is not counted in distinct
17/11/21, 10:50 pm - +65 8337 3637: Well the catch was it was not asked count distinct

It was asked what will select distinct return
17/11/21, 10:51 pm - +65 8337 3637: Select distinct column returns null as well
17/11/21, 10:52 pm - +65 8337 3637: While select count( distinct) will not return count for null rows
17/11/21, 10:57 pm - +91 88988 90243: I think it will return null as well

17/11/21, 10:59 pm - +65 8337 3637: Even I marked 1
As i thought they are asking count
17/11/21, 10:59 pm - +65 8337 3637: This title value is not null. It looks like empty string
17/11/21, 10:59 pm - +65 8337 3637: Try insert ( NULL)
17/11/21, 11:00 pm - +65 8337 3637: So
Values ( 2, NULL, 30)
17/11/21, 11:01 pm - +91 88988 90243: I think in question in was empty string only not null
17/11/21, 11:02 pm - +65 8337 3637: Oh is it. I dont remember it now
Then the answer wud be 2 only right?
17/11/21, 11:03 pm - +65 8337 3637: But is mysql rendering it differently?
I do not have mysql. I have oracle.
Can u try inserting NULL and see if it shows blank in the rows or (null)

Select count( distinct r ) gives you 1?
Or 2?
17/11/21, 11:05 pm - +91 95813 23427: count(distinct(manager)) gives 1
17/11/21, 11:06 pm - +91 95813 23427: so null values are not counted, but can be a distinct value.
17/11/21, 11:07 pm - +65 8337 3637: Yea
So be it empty string or NULl
The answer to the question wud be 2
17/11/21, 11:07 pm - +65 8337 3637: Thanks for testing out though. Helped in getting some clarity

19/11/21, 2:25 am - +61 435 080 700: Hi Guys..
Can somebody explain this..

I dont understand the below answer. Why is it O(1)? 
My understanding was below...,
The list is unordered , and neither max / min excludes 2 possible values , but still we need to search the rest of the list to locate the number, which leads to O(n)
19/11/21, 2:41 am - +91 89210 23935: If we have 3 distinct number, then we can find a number which is neither max or min by looking at the third number.
Because in 3 distinct numbers, there will be a number for sure which is neither a maximum or minimum.

[1,5,8,...] With 3 numbers min will be 1 or less, max will be 8 or more. 5 will be neither maximum or minimum. We only need one number which is neither min or maximum so we don't have to go through the entire list, only need to look at the third element.
19/11/21, 2:42 am - +91 89210 23935: first 3 elements*
19/11/21, 2:46 am - +61 435 080 700: Oh great ..that explains itüòÉ
19/11/21, 2:47 am - +61 435 080 700: So the question should be more clear ...like 
Number of comparisons to find anyone** element
19/11/21, 2:48 am - +61 435 080 700: I thought it is asking number of comparisons to find a given element
19/11/21, 2:48 am - +61 435 080 700: Thanks!!
19/11/21, 3:58 am - +91 83329 81498: Made the same mistake haha
19/11/21, 8:36 am - +91 73825 54571: Without comparing n numbers how can a compiler know max num is 8
19/11/21, 8:39 am - +91 83329 81498: We don't need to compare it to the max element. We just need to find a element that's neither max nor min. Can be done with 3 numbers.
19/11/21, 8:40 am - +91 73825 54571: Yu have to find an element with n comparisions to find it if it is max or min
19/11/21, 8:40 am - +91 83329 81498: For ex in the list there could 0 and 16 at the end. But we know for sure 3 is not max or min.
19/11/21, 8:40 am - +91 83329 81498: Which is what they need
19/11/21, 8:41 am - +91 73825 54571: Compiler doesnt know before performing comparision
19/11/21, 8:42 am - +91 73825 54571: I cant agree ur explaination
.im sorry may be u r right but i cant agree

19/11/21, 8:45 am - +91 83329 81498: List: [...........,1,3,8,...............,0,16]
Let's say max : 16, min = 0.
Question: number of comparisons to find if an element is neither max nor min
Target value: 3
We need to find if 3 is neither max nor min
We take 2 random element. In this case adjacent elements to 3.  a=1,b=3,c=8.
If one of these two is greater than 3, then 3 is not the maximum element in the list. If one of these is less than 3, then 3 is not the minimum in this list. 1 is less than 3. So 3 is not min of the list. 8 is greater than 3. so 3 is not max of list. 

We can now say 3 is neither max nor min.
We did this in O(1). 

We don't necessarily have to compare with the actual max and min.

19/11/21, 8:53 am - +91 78756 85040: One really don't have to compare with all elements to find such number.
19/11/21, 8:53 am - +91 78756 85040: *element

19/11/21, 9:06 am - +91 94529 09216: Sorry this is wrong
19/11/21, 9:09 am - +61 435 080 700: Hope u understood now.
Just pick any element which is not max or min.
If we pick first 3 element in the array itself, the solution can be found.
Given that array length is more than 2.

19/11/21, 10:43 am - +91 89210 23935: I said max number is 8 or more, min number os 1 or less.

[1,5,8,...]

0th pass
MaxTillNow = None
MinTillNow= None
NotMaxOrMin = None

After checking first element.

MaxTillNow = 1
MinTillNow= None
NotMaxOrMin = None

After checking second element.

MaxTillNow = 5
MinTillNow= 1
NotMaxOrMin = None

After checking third element.

MaxTillNow = 8
MinTillNow= 1
NotMaxOrMin = 5

In the list of [1,5,8, 99, 0], you don't need the information that 99 is max to know that 5 is neither max or min. You just need to know first 3 elements since all numbers are unique
19/11/21, 10:49 am - +91 89210 23935: Let's say the question is to find *anyone* who is not the richest person or the poorest person in india. You don't need to know the bank balance of ambani to tell that answer, just need to know 3 peoples Bank balance.
19/11/21, 10:50 am - +91 89210 23935: Assuming all are unique
19/11/21, 10:53 am - +91 73825 54571: Ok
19/11/21, 10:53 am - +91 73825 54571: üëç
19/11/21, 11:12 am - +91 88988 90243: Perfect
While solving I assumed sorting is required
Which is incorrect

19/11/21, 11:49 am - +65 8337 3637: These are yt channels. They have playlists for git
19/11/21, 11:50 am - +65 8337 3637: And I wud recommend Corey Schafer for anything related to Python
19/11/21, 11:50 am - +91 95370 26661: Thanks man.

19/11/21, 12:06 pm - +91 88988 90243: Has anyone worked on code review checklist?
19/11/21, 2:02 pm - +91 89210 23935: I have 3 tables.
MoviesFrom80s with movieid, rating.
MoviesFrom90s with movieid, rating.
MoviesTable with movieid, title.

I want to select movies from 80s which has ratings greater than 9 and movies from 90s which has ratings greater than 8. How do I do this?.

I AM STUCK WITH HOW TO COMBINE..

To select movies from 80s. 
*SELECT movieid FROM MoviesFrom80s WHERE rating >9*

To select movies from 90s. 
*SELECT movieid FROM MoviesFrom90s WHERE rating >8*

How do I select *title* from MoviesTable from these two sub queries?
19/11/21, 2:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: The two queries will list movieid.. what will be the final query?
19/11/21, 2:04 pm - +91 89210 23935: Also is there any alternative approach
19/11/21, 2:04 pm - +91 88988 90243: Union all?
19/11/21, 2:16 pm - +91 88988 90243: Select title from moviestable
Where movie id 
In
(Select movie id from movie80

Union all

Select movieif from movie90)
19/11/21, 2:17 pm - +91 88988 90243: Understood?
19/11/21, 2:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes.. but I realised my problem is bit complicated than that..

I need a better example. But what if MoviesFrom80s contains movies from 70s also..
MoviesFrom90s also contains movies from 70s.

And I want movies common in both result set.

This may not make logic to do that. But what if I have two sub queries, I want common elements in both.
19/11/21, 2:22 pm - +91 89210 23935: This message was deleted
19/11/21, 2:24 pm - +91 89210 23935: Q1. SELECT ID FROM TABLE1 where condition
Q2. SELECT ID FROM TABLE2 where condition

FINAL QUERY I need is
Select title from ID common in both Q1 and Q2
19/11/21, 2:29 pm - +65 8337 3637: Since you want common rows
Do Inner Join between the two tables
Then the resultant IDs is used to get title..
19/11/21, 2:29 pm - +65 8337 3637: I believe instead of union, join shid do the trick
19/11/21, 2:29 pm - +91 94529 09216: <Media omitted>
19/11/21, 2:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: Inner join will work
19/11/21, 2:30 pm - +65 8337 3637: üëç
19/11/21, 2:30 pm - +91 88988 90243: Yeah
I misunderstood the question
19/11/21, 2:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: Please use alias also
19/11/21, 2:30 pm - +91 88988 90243: Inner join will work
19/11/21, 2:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: Thank you.. it works.. üòÅ
Thank you @919452909216  @6583373637  @918898890243

19/11/21, 2:41 pm - +65 8337 3637: üëçüëç
Helps us also when solving... üòä
19/11/21, 2:59 pm - +91 88988 90243: If you want to do this in python 
Do it using Sets instead of joins
That will be faster
19/11/21, 3:10 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes.. set1.intersection(set2) could be faster as join is compute heavy
19/11/21, 3:16 pm - +91 99998 58727: You can run sql queries in python also using pandasql package. 

We use it a lot in our day to day job
19/11/21, 3:18 pm - +91 99998 58727: Just in case you want jupyter notebook environment ‚úåüèª
19/11/21, 3:20 pm - +91 88988 90243: Last month I learnt regarding pyinstaller

We had two Queries sql and python which needed to run sequentially

We used Pyodbc package in python and called sql script 

Finally we created exe file using Pyinstaller package

User just have to click on that exe and process will execute
19/11/21, 3:22 pm - +91 99998 58727: Can you share more details with me on this regards. I have a similar use case
19/11/21, 3:22 pm - +91 89210 23935: How is it different from sqlite3?
19/11/21, 3:22 pm - +91 99998 58727: Mostly same just syntax can be a bit different
19/11/21, 3:24 pm - +91 99998 58727: As currently we use Postgres so MySQL has some of the commands different where as prestosql is way too different than these both

19/11/21, 4:20 pm - +91 88988 90243: I want to create a webpage where user can upload his code

Then python will read it and check some details
19/11/21, 4:21 pm - +91 88988 90243: How can it be created?
19/11/21, 4:23 pm - +91 83329 81498: do you want the user to be able to execute their files?
19/11/21, 4:24 pm - +91 83329 81498: that's more complicated
19/11/21, 4:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: What is kubernetes, kubeflow  etc..? How are these related to docker?
19/11/21, 4:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: I want to have a broad overview of all these including sagemaker... what is a good resource for broad overview of all the deployment stuffs?
19/11/21, 4:36 pm - +91 99599 32345: Try checking Applied AI youtube channel, I think they made some live videos on these topics
19/11/21, 4:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: They are detailed videos I think. Each session is more than 1.5 hrs long. Sagemaker is 4 live sessions..
19/11/21, 4:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: I know we will learn these in this sem itself..
19/11/21, 4:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: In productionization and deployment module
19/11/21, 4:39 pm - +65 8337 3637: I don't think Kubernetes wud be in this course
19/11/21, 4:39 pm - +91 89210 23935: They might be optional
19/11/21, 4:39 pm - +91 97018 27354: Dockers = container, Kubernetetes = orchestration platform you would use to control your container cluster.
19/11/21, 4:39 pm - +65 8337 3637: That is a vast area..
Briefly, if you know docker, Kubernetes is a mechanism and tool to manage docker at scale..

19/11/21, 4:42 pm - +91 97018 27354: (For kubernetes)
19/11/21, 4:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: What are the alternatives to docker and kubernetes?
19/11/21, 4:45 pm - +91 89210 23935: Used in the industry
19/11/21, 4:46 pm - +91 97018 27354: NONE in industry. Microsoft bought few startups that focus on few niche areas but your canonical standard is kubernetes.
19/11/21, 4:47 pm - +91 97018 27354: n docker
19/11/21, 4:48 pm - +65 8337 3637: Linux has an open source containerization, Windows have one.. but never seen it used anywhere
19/11/21, 4:48 pm - +91 97018 27354: redhad n vmvare have something, IDK
19/11/21, 4:49 pm - +65 8337 3637: I dont even know any alternative to Kubernetes
But have only worked on flavours of Kubernetes..
Open Shift by red hat is built on Kubernetes
19/11/21, 4:50 pm - +65 8337 3637: Never heard of this one... Is it good?
I know of acloudguru
19/11/21, 4:50 pm - +65 8337 3637: Is it similar?
19/11/21, 4:50 pm - +91 97018 27354: yup basically sab kubernetes typ apna apna bana rahe hain
19/11/21, 4:50 pm - +91 99998 58727: VMware has Tanzu as kubernetes cluster

19/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 97018 27354: Thanks. Everyone is cooking something.
19/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 97018 27354: :p
19/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 99998 58727: In our course they will be using sage maker right?
19/11/21, 4:52 pm - +91 99998 58727: For deployment
19/11/21, 4:52 pm - +65 8337 3637: Oh ok.. i have corporate membership.. so not complaining there üòúüòú
19/11/21, 4:52 pm - +65 8337 3637: Not course. I guess optional resources
19/11/21, 4:53 pm - +91 99998 58727: Deployment is optional resource üò∂

20/11/21, 12:54 pm - +91 99116 67917: Dude this statistic is killing me. It's very hard to understand and then to apply it in real-world scenarios is way over me.

20/11/21, 1:13 pm - +91 89210 23935: Maybe tomorrow sometime after session seems fine. Extending to next week is a long time. Maybe we can take a poll on telegram
20/11/21, 1:15 pm - +61 435 080 700: I think it can be done only if we do full time..no matter how much I try , I can not finish assignment n lessons in a week.
20/11/21, 1:16 pm - +91 96189 23985: Even i feel the same..i got covid in september, then my father got admitted to hosp..all these while doing ofc work and household work..i dint evn finish the videos properly üò¢üò¢
20/11/21, 1:22 pm - +91 89210 23935: Maybe spending two 30 mins session in the morning, and two 30 min session in the evening or in the night for 5-6 days a week will give 10-12 hours per week. Our weekly content is 6 to 7 hours.
20/11/21, 1:24 pm - +61 435 080 700: Yes that's right content is 7 hrs a week
20/11/21, 1:24 pm - +91 77748 96465: Dude even though content is 6-7hr...u can't consume that content in 6-7hrs
20/11/21, 1:24 pm - +91 77748 96465: Need atleast 10hr
20/11/21, 1:25 pm - +91 96189 23985: true
20/11/21, 1:25 pm - +61 435 080 700: But Just watching videos is not enough
20/11/21, 1:25 pm - +91 77748 96465: And there is revision and practice after that
20/11/21, 1:27 pm - +91 89210 23935: That's why showed a realistic 10-12 hours per week plan
20/11/21, 1:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: If 6 hours was enough, we could just spent 30 mins in morning and evening for 6 days and all done.
20/11/21, 1:28 pm - +91 77748 96465: Ya ..but for non cs guys it's not enough I feel

20/11/21, 3:16 pm - +91 72648 49874: Buy a book called business statistics 7th edition and anoyher one named discovering Statistics With R. Ignore the tools used. Focus on the concepts. Without statistics and probability data science is nothing.
20/11/21, 3:18 pm - +91 72648 49874: With these books you'll learn everything you ever need

20/11/21, 6:06 pm - +91 99116 67917: Will look for ri8 now. 
Thanks for it
20/11/21, 6:15 pm - +91 99998 58727: This JD has everything what data scientist/ML engineer role asks for üòÑ
20/11/21, 6:16 pm - +91 99998 58727: Sometimes I feel these titles are used relatively interchangeably
20/11/21, 6:21 pm - +65 8337 3637: True. I was hired as a spark/kafka streaming developer in the current organization. That project shelved so I had to become Tableau developer and also did a prj as full stack developer as well.. 
Like what sir mentioned today- make urself tool agnostic.
20/11/21, 6:22 pm - +65 8337 3637: Nowadays JD includes everything an IT project needs.. nothing less üòÉ
20/11/21, 6:23 pm - +91 89399 22582: Do we have DS/MLE in this group? If so, can you please share the best practices/experience/thoughts of work-life in companies
20/11/21, 6:45 pm - +91 95370 26661: Hey how's the data science department and profiles there?
20/11/21, 7:21 pm - +91 72648 49874: Data cleansing ia tirong and never ending. Analysis is most useful. Machine learning is hardly 20% in many cases. Deep learning is even less. Statistical inference rules the day. Data visualization and data engineering are roots and fruits of everything. üëç
20/11/21, 7:23 pm - +65 8337 3637: üëç

20/11/21, 7:25 pm - +91 99208 18609: Haha I know. To be honest what we are looking for is Data preprocessing skills, some experience with ETL tools. Decent DSA and SQL skills. And Google cloud computing experience.
20/11/21, 7:26 pm - +91 99208 18609: It's really great. The peer learning is amazing.
20/11/21, 7:28 pm - +91 95370 26661: Thats good to hear. What is the opportunity situation for people having around 1 year of exp
20/11/21, 7:28 pm - +91 95370 26661: Whats an ideal data scientist candidate according to them?
20/11/21, 7:34 pm - +91 97396 15111: Can anyone help me out here ? I‚Äôm into software Testing will this course help in the testing ?
20/11/21, 7:37 pm - +91 72648 49874: Using deep learning we can do bug finding and defect finding. Search on Google and you'll get a blog.
20/11/21, 8:01 pm - +91 99208 18609: They are hiring for DS 1 positions as well (1-2 years experience). 
Majorly they focus on stats, probability and python and good understanding of traditional algos. The level of questions would range from easy to medium. Out 10 maybe 6-7 easy and 3-4 hard questions.
20/11/21, 8:09 pm - +91 95370 26661: Thank you for this.

20/11/21, 10:04 pm - +91 96184 80572: Hi
20/11/21, 10:04 pm - +91 96184 80572: Is the session conducted today?
20/11/21, 10:15 pm - +91 89399 22582: Thank you, really helpful infoüëç
20/11/21, 11:18 pm - +91 93988 08159: This is 200% accurate. A great deal of time is spent in checking the correctness of the data, deriving insights as to which data to use and what to discard. Modelling, though is the final product, in most(not all) cases, it is data and the features we build that matters.
20/11/21, 11:32 pm - +91 72648 49874: The reason why such is the scenario is because of 2 reasons: 1. to get the data relevant for ML is like cracking IIT JEE - 15lac+ students may sit for the exam but there are only 4k-5k seats! 2. most ML projects do not sustain for longer days in Production because of over or under optimization or wrong solution chosen for the given problem. Reality is different than Kaggle !
21/11/21, 12:23 am - +91 88003 13691: Sure
21/11/21, 12:28 am - +91 72045 68400: Okay
21/11/21, 12:28 am - +91 72045 68400: 8
21/11/21, 12:28 am - +91 72045 68400: Please share the details
21/11/21, 12:47 am - +91 88003 13691: I'll share details by tomorrow morning if that's not an issue
21/11/21, 12:48 am - +91 72045 68400: Sure. Thanks
21/11/21, 5:39 am - +1 (610) 505-1068: Anyone recording the career coaching session today ?
21/11/21, 7:43 am - +91 78935 18350: In yesterday's live session, sir told that we shouldn't record. The guest lecturer don't want to share his content on any other platform it seems.
21/11/21, 7:46 am - +91 88988 90243: Oh got it
21/11/21, 7:47 am - +91 88640 27876: You can use bandicam Software to record
21/11/21, 9:04 am - +91 89399 22582: Great exampleüëèüëç
For identifying imp features do we use model based techniques, like RF top features?
21/11/21, 9:10 am - +91 89399 22582: I think the reason FeatureStore came into existence
21/11/21, 9:11 am - +91 99998 58727: Yes you can use them. You can even check permutation importance of each variable. 

If you‚Äôre building simple linear or logistic regression model then you have to check multi collinearity as well.
21/11/21, 9:11 am - +91 89399 22582: <Media omitted>
21/11/21, 10:10 am - +91 72648 49874: Yes . but that part comes later - think first about data sourcing. that's the biggest hurdle in real life, followed by data storage and cleaning. all this falls under data engg. That's why courses, like our diploma program, covers Spark for example and SQL.
21/11/21, 10:12 am - +65 8337 3637: üíØüíØ
21/11/21, 10:14 am - +65 8337 3637: In my experience, although not as a DS or ML engr, the models end up as just PoCs because of lack of experience and infra to ingest data from source to the model in time..
21/11/21, 10:17 am - +91 72648 49874: True. Many times it is the requirement itself which is not made clear, and also lack of processes. The ones which stay for long are actually built out of basic ML Algorithms like linear and logistic regression if we choose to believe this! Why so? because they are the most simplest in terms of explanation to clients and stakeholders. No one from management is interested in XGBoost with 97% accuracy if they are not able to understand the solution; instead they'll prefer Logistic regression which is far better explanable for anyone.
21/11/21, 10:20 am - +91 87926 47374: For those who are working , IJP are the best way to switch career in ML
21/11/21, 10:23 am - +91 96184 80572: Guys can you please summarise last sessions important points if possible
21/11/21, 10:30 am - +65 8337 3637: I so relate to ur xgboost statement there. A senior stakeholder from client side kept asking.. are we thinking about regression after every meeting üòÉ

21/11/21, 12:48 pm - +91 99116 67917: YTB
21/11/21, 12:51 pm - +91 78699 91392: What‚Äôs the topic of zoom meeting ??
21/11/21, 12:52 pm - +91 89210 23935: Do you think workwith<name>@gmail.com is a good email?
21/11/21, 12:53 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think he mentioned jobsfor<name>@gmail.com
21/11/21, 12:53 pm - +91 83329 81498: if i were a recruiter i would choose sandyrocks over workwithsandeep any day. seems more fun
21/11/21, 12:54 pm - +91 83329 81498: workwithsandeep is the type of guy who was foodforsandeep account for food apps and socialmediaforsandeep for social media accounts
21/11/21, 12:55 pm - +91 99116 67917: Casual chat on domain - Future Project Discussion - Implementation and Deployment- day to day life of Data Scientists/ Analyst / ML Engineer etc
21/11/21, 12:55 pm - +91 89210 23935: I wouldn't hehe. I think every details matter. And it tells you are serious about it.
I would select jobsforsandeep over sandeep007
21/11/21, 12:55 pm - +91 83329 81498: just joking bro.
21/11/21, 12:55 pm - +91 94529 09216: I would be ready to work for such recruiters even at lesser salary
21/11/21, 12:55 pm - +91 94529 09216: üòÇ
21/11/21, 12:56 pm - +91 78699 91392: Thanks
21/11/21, 12:56 pm - +91 99116 67917: I think you can have your complete name and end with birth year ( was common in 90's )
21/11/21, 12:57 pm - +91 99116 67917: üëç
21/11/21, 12:57 pm - +91 77310 00298: At what time Zoom meeting will have
21/11/21, 12:58 pm - +91 99116 67917: Yet To Be Announced
21/11/21, 1:55 pm - +65 8337 3637: I would advise against it. The best is to have your initials.. even just first alphabets are ok. Type in ur middle name, father's name if required. But
<name>.<middlename>.<lastname>@gmail.com should be the way to go....
Again my opinion on this
21/11/21, 1:56 pm - +65 8337 3637: If you noticed, his email id was also
Just his firstname.. although he could afford to have a @vikramanand.com
21/11/21, 1:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: But the problem is availability of such emails
21/11/21, 2:03 pm - +65 8337 3637: Totally agree..hence give ur middle name or just the initial of ur middle name

For e.g. if my name is
Mohammed Fahad
If i dont get mohammed.fahad
Then try mohd.fahad
Or just fahad
Or m.fahad

And we can use numbers as long as numbers are not of religious significance like 786, some cheesy stuff like 007 or innuendos like 69..
21/11/21, 2:06 pm - +91 92058 52308: Guys, don't get stuck with email,not to loss your focus from rest of things.

First do 1st cut solution all the step mentioned in the video then improved them further.
21/11/21, 2:08 pm - +91 70734 10928: Did anyone try to change the url ?
Actually I am trying to change it and keeping only my name but it is not accepting it. It is taking any two digit number also. Why it is so..? Sir has shown us only by name. Did anyone try that ?
21/11/21, 2:08 pm - +91 70734 10928: For LinkedIn
21/11/21, 2:09 pm - +65 8337 3637: I did it during the webinar itself.. worked for me
21/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 75690 61914: May be someone with same name might have used it before.
21/11/21, 2:09 pm - +65 8337 3637: It needs to be unique.. someone else has stolen that id it seems
21/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 85228 11388: I tried the same,not worked for me..
21/11/21, 2:09 pm - +91 70734 10928: Mine is saying just something went worng. Try again.
21/11/21, 2:10 pm - +91 97018 27354: I come across 007 quite often.
21/11/21, 2:10 pm - +91 97018 27354: üí©
21/11/21, 2:10 pm - +91 92058 52308: Hey I just tried and worked for me.

21/11/21, 2:11 pm - +65 8337 3637: üòÉüòÉ
Another one that I cringe is something like
Fahad_developer@gmail
21/11/21, 2:11 pm - +91 70734 10928: Okay. It may be. Then what should I put this..and why sir didn't point out this because there are so many people having similar names then in this case what we should keep this ?
21/11/21, 2:12 pm - +91 92058 52308: Try with firstname_lastname
21/11/21, 2:12 pm - +91 70734 10928: Ohh..yes got some idea. We can put double same letter somewhere in our name so it will be different I think.
21/11/21, 2:12 pm - +65 8337 3637: Again try to add your middle name or something unique to urself... Without it being gibberish...

Also, this shud be thr last thing you shud worry abt changing on LinkedIn..
Maybe u will figure out by the time u are ready for interviews üòä
21/11/21, 2:13 pm - +91 70734 10928: No it is no t taking underscore
21/11/21, 2:13 pm - +65 8337 3637: It will take hyphen
21/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 92058 52308: Priyanshu_Agrawal ?
21/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes it is.
21/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 90357 92877: Does all this really matter thoüòÖ
If a company rejects you just because your linkedin url is not proper then I would consider it a good thing and a bullet dodged
21/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 70734 10928: No
21/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 92058 52308: üòÇüòÇ
21/11/21, 2:14 pm - +91 70734 10928: üòÇ
21/11/21, 2:15 pm - +91 70734 10928: Just curious to change it. That's why. Nothing else. Btw thanks to all for the suggestions.
21/11/21, 2:17 pm - +91 70734 10928: And can anyone tell me that what should be the resume length for just one year experience person and fir fresher?
21/11/21, 2:17 pm - +65 8337 3637: üòÉüòÉ
21/11/21, 2:17 pm - +91 70734 10928: *for
21/11/21, 2:18 pm - +91 70734 10928: And for non cs student ?
21/11/21, 2:24 pm - +65 8337 3637: Between 1 and 2 max.. for any fresher upto 1 yr of exp...
You will not have a readable one in just 1 page.. you can spill over some to page 2..but shud end way before page2 ends...

24/11/21, 11:27 am - +91 82917 29337: If someone gets answer 6,  just try to explain the internal implementation of 4th line in pic..
24/11/21, 11:32 am - +65 8337 3637: It is the & symbol that u are using
24/11/21, 11:32 am - +65 8337 3637: U shud use "and" keyword
24/11/21, 11:33 am - +65 8337 3637: & is not a logical operator... In python it is the word "and"
24/11/21, 11:52 am - +91 82917 29337: Yes,I know if I use logical "and" the program will turn simple and output to find max of three numbers will surely be 7....
24/11/21, 11:52 am - +91 82917 29337: For given code snippet with Bitwise & ....tell the o/p for given I/P's..
24/11/21, 11:59 am - +91 82917 29337: If will tell my approach...

Given expression is 
max=a if a>b & a>c else b if b>c else c


So...if 7>4 which gives value True(as we are using relational operators) ,also 7>6 which will also give True, 

now True(convert into decimal one and then represent into 32/64 bit form since we are going to use bitwise operator,hence 000...001) & True(000...0001), now the output of bitwise & will come as 000..0001,

now since we are using if statment corresponding bitwise representation of 1(ie 000..0001) will be type casted into decimal 1 and then further type casted into Boolean value True ,hence finally output should be a=7
24/11/21, 12:02 pm - +91 82917 29337: P.S :I am not a newbie in python,I have good experience with it.

But,Yesterday I suddenly met with this expression, wasn't able to find answer  as 6....

If someone gets value as 6,try to ellaborate ur solution, Thanks..üëç
24/11/21, 12:03 pm - +65 8337 3637: Oh i just did a quick reading.. never thought about that. It is about order of operations...
24/11/21, 12:03 pm - +65 8337 3637: Which feels weird to me..
So look at this .
I need to dig deeper but in the surface it is not evaluating the two side operations as we would intend it to

24/11/21, 12:05 pm - +65 8337 3637: I do not have sufficient knowledge to comment on why.. but a quick check revealed somehow & is operated on before the relational operations

24/11/21, 12:07 pm - +91 82917 29337: YeahüòÇit's about precedence of operators....I remembered just now 

Answer is bitwise operators have more precedence than shift operators
24/11/21, 12:08 pm - +91 82917 29337: Thanks..üëç
24/11/21, 12:08 pm - +65 8337 3637: Yup.. never read about it..

24/11/21, 12:16 pm - +91 96505 18893: Is it the similar to that?
24/11/21, 12:18 pm - +65 8337 3637: Yes, that was also on order of operations
But between and / or operators
24/11/21, 12:30 pm - +91 82371 27097: Thanks Adarsh and Fahad. Enlightening conversation
24/11/21, 12:33 pm - +91 82917 29337: Yeah maybe, but I guess diploma course haven't  taught about chaining of relational operators(which makes python more special  as compared to remaining languages)
24/11/21, 12:35 pm - +91 72648 49874: True
24/11/21, 12:36 pm - +91 82917 29337: Detailed solution will be

max=a if a>b & a>c else b if b>c else c

So ,first by precedence of operator, b & a ( ie 4 &7) will come out as 4....then  7>4>6 (by using chaining of relational operator concept) will turn out to be False
24/11/21, 12:59 pm - +91 96505 18893: Okay

24/11/21, 2:32 pm - +91 97912 22474: Hi guys, I need a small suggestion. I have started learning Python and have been practicing for a while. Now, I am thinking to learn Data structures. But, some are saying that learning data structures in c++ is better(I just know the basics of c++). So, which is better.. learning data structures in Python or c++?
24/11/21, 2:51 pm - +91 83329 81498: concept of data structures is not limited to any language. the implementation could be different in each language but it's a general idea on how to store data in different ways.
24/11/21, 2:52 pm - +91 83329 81498: you can learn them in python
24/11/21, 2:52 pm - +91 83329 81498: implement*
24/11/21, 2:52 pm - +91 80083 60079: If we learn in python, is it enough?
24/11/21, 2:53 pm - +91 83329 81498: what exactly do you mean by enough? the concept is same in c or c++ or python
24/11/21, 2:53 pm - +91 80083 60079: Got it!

24/11/21, 2:54 pm - +91 88003 13691: Data structures like binary trees and all?
24/11/21, 2:57 pm - +91 83329 81498: yes
24/11/21, 2:58 pm - +91 88003 13691: Okayy
24/11/21, 3:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: If I were to learn it, I would definitely learn it in c++ eventho it would take me more effort
24/11/21, 3:03 pm - +91 97912 22474: Some said that in c++, you have pointers concept. So, it's better understand Data structures in c++ than in Python. That's why I am confused what to choose
24/11/21, 3:06 pm - +91 92058 52308: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ
24/11/21, 3:06 pm - +91 92058 52308: This good resources to DSA from scratch.
24/11/21, 3:08 pm - +91 83329 81498: the same concept, you implement in c++ using pointers (the way they are originally intended and the reason why they are better) or you can learn concepts and implement in python using classes and objects(since there is no concept of pointers in python). it's up to you at the end of the day. you don't need a deep understanding of c++ to implement data structures anyway. knowing basics is enough to get started
24/11/21, 3:08 pm - +91 82371 27097: Thanks
24/11/21, 3:10 pm - +91 97912 22474: Okay Thanks

24/11/21, 3:54 pm - +91 99998 58727: Between logical and & bitwise & which has more precedence?
24/11/21, 3:54 pm - +91 99998 58727: It would be interesting to find 

a and b & c
24/11/21, 4:02 pm - +65 8337 3637: Bitwise takes precedence
24/11/21, 4:10 pm - +91 82917 29337: Bitwise operators has more precedence than Logical operator

Order for precedence is:
Paranthesis>Exponential operator>Unary operator >Arithmetic operator> Shift operators>Bitwise operators>Relational operators & Equality operators>Assignment & Complex Assignment Operators>Identity Operators>Membership Operators>Logical operators

24/11/21, 6:14 pm - +91 82371 27097: Btw, what's up with the inputs? Do we take it from the user or is it okay use numpy to build a random list?
24/11/21, 6:15 pm - +91 82371 27097: Haven't submitted the assignment because of it
24/11/21, 6:15 pm - +91 77748 96465: In one of the live session sir told to implement without exponent operator or math library
24/11/21, 6:15 pm - +91 82371 27097: Oh shit üòÇ
24/11/21, 6:15 pm - +91 77748 96465: I think he suggested to use binary search and gradient descent...I dnt remember if it was for same prblm
24/11/21, 6:16 pm - +91 77748 96465: But Smithing similar
24/11/21, 6:17 pm - +91 89783 80243: Today I have submitted it and confirmed with mentor about code.They told it is giving their desired output.

I have used custom input data.

Only problem will be with percentile and MAD calculation .but percentage of error is fine as per them.
24/11/21, 6:18 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yes not binary search but using mid value and same logic we can divide and arrive at sqrt
24/11/21, 6:18 pm - +91 99998 58727: But this is simplest solution I feel why to complicate 

X**0.5 is solving the problem without using library function.
24/11/21, 6:18 pm - +91 82371 27097: Did you also calculate all the 8 parameters according to numpy/scipy too, for comparison? Or that isnt needed in the code, and they'll do it themselves?
24/11/21, 6:19 pm - +91 99998 58727: You sent them in mail or they confirmed you in comments section?
24/11/21, 6:19 pm - +91 82371 27097: I've used the same line in my code. But if we've been told not to use exponential operations for sqrt too, then gotta revisit the entire assignment
24/11/21, 6:19 pm - +91 77748 96465: I mean not getting exact value for MAD using library and my implementation
24/11/21, 6:19 pm - +91 77748 96465: Slight deviation
24/11/21, 6:20 pm - +91 82371 27097: Yeah, apparently that's supposed to happen

24/11/21, 6:21 pm - +91 89783 80243: I didn't used any inbuilt functions,numpy/scipy.i have not included numpy in code,but used it for comparison of the both outputs
24/11/21, 6:22 pm - +91 82371 27097: No, according to the comments, it's due to how MAD is implemented internally and will be addressed in detail in some live session

24/11/21, 6:23 pm - +91 89783 80243: Through mail
24/11/21, 6:24 pm - +91 89783 80243: As we did earlier for assignments. use input data with spaces

24/11/21, 6:25 pm - +91 89783 80243: Yes.
24/11/21, 6:28 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yeah same thing I‚Äôm doing
24/11/21, 6:30 pm - +91 89783 80243: If anyone finds effective method for percentile calculation apart from linear interpolation.let us know for reducing the error.
24/11/21, 6:30 pm - +91 99998 58727: Just one more thing Bhanu if you can confirm or anyone has confirmed with the team..

In variance and s.d do we have to consider population or sample one.... 

I‚Äôm considering sample as 1,2,3,4,5 is just a sample
24/11/21, 6:31 pm - +91 99998 58727: So accordingly formula will differ. And I don‚Äôt know what numpy actually calculates by considering n or n-1
24/11/21, 6:31 pm - +91 99998 58727: Because in sample we use n-1
24/11/21, 6:35 pm - +91 89783 80243: My output values with numpy is exactly matching with taking indices up to n-1 for variance and standard deviation,mean,median.

Deviations are more in IQR, MAD, percentiles
24/11/21, 6:36 pm - +91 99998 58727: Thanks for confirmation. I was also using n-1 only

24/11/21, 7:06 pm - +91 89783 80243: As per my understanding, main objective is to derive the output values without using main inbuilt functions in one line of code..it is ok to use round() int() or ceil()floor() functions for rounding off.

24/11/21, 7:07 pm - +91 82371 27097: I did the same
24/11/21, 7:08 pm - +91 78756 85040: We can use inbuilt functions,  right?
24/11/21, 7:08 pm - +91 96505 18893: As far as i understood the assessment we cannot use any library functions ‚Ä¶ but python inbuilt functions can be used
24/11/21, 7:09 pm - +91 82371 27097: Yeah, that's what I've interpreted from the "no libraries" rule
24/11/21, 7:10 pm - +91 96505 18893: Sqrt we use math library‚Ä¶ so for that we should do from scratch but for others i think it is okay to use ‚Ä¶

24/11/21, 8:43 pm - +91 99998 58727: First you have to download the data set
24/11/21, 8:43 pm - +91 99998 58727: You can find the link to dataset in comments
24/11/21, 8:44 pm - +91 97396 15111: I have already downloaded
24/11/21, 8:44 pm - +91 75690 61914: Place the file in the folder where your ipython notebook is placed.
24/11/21, 8:44 pm - +91 99998 58727: Is your jupyter file and dataset are in same location?
24/11/21, 8:45 pm - +91 97396 15111: ok so it should not be within the files of jupyter notebook?
24/11/21, 8:45 pm - +91 97396 15111: what if i am using pycharm
24/11/21, 8:45 pm - +91 99998 58727: It can be but then you have to give proper path
24/11/21, 8:46 pm - +91 97396 15111: do we mention the file path in the code?
24/11/21, 8:46 pm - +91 99998 58727: Example 
data/iris/iris.csv 

Like that. Data and iris are hypothetical folder names
24/11/21, 8:46 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yes
24/11/21, 8:47 pm - +91 99998 58727: It should all be in quotes
24/11/21, 8:47 pm - +91 97396 15111: where do we have to give the file path ? can you share me the syntax ?
24/11/21, 8:47 pm - +91 99116 67917: Try this :


url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"

dataset = pd.read_csv(url)
24/11/21, 8:47 pm - +91 99998 58727: Pd.read_csv(‚Äòpath‚Äô)
24/11/21, 8:47 pm - +91 97396 15111: ahh ok will try this
24/11/21, 8:48 pm - +91 97396 15111: i tried this it did not work
24/11/21, 8:49 pm - +91 97396 15111: This worked thanks, instead of the website url i can also put in the file path right ?
24/11/21, 8:49 pm - +91 99116 67917: Correct !!!
24/11/21, 8:49 pm - +91 99116 67917: Url itself is the path.

26/11/21, 1:48 am - +91 99721 79093: I wonder what is the mean, SD and MAD of the salary offers given to these 50% people.
26/11/21, 1:51 am - +91 99116 67917: Could be that the 3-month content which they taught in their 9-month program, was enough to crack the job which they claim. As per their website, it says :

Highest CTC: 23 LPA, Average CTC: 10.5 LPA for the Class of 2021
26/11/21, 2:08 am - +91 99721 79093: Interesting, again number can be glorified for marketing purpose.
26/11/21, 2:08 am - +91 99116 67917: True.
26/11/21, 2:14 am - +91 97018 27354: More than 60 programs participated; sure why bother giving the exact number, even though you call yourself analyticsindiamag.com, why bother? Seriously, how gullible do they think people are?

26/11/21, 2:23 am - +91 97018 27354: Variety of people belonging to different age groups join these programs for a variety of reasons. Such inferences shouldn't be made without knowing the cohort size and profiles of students. My take, all ranking lists are just for üí© marketing.
26/11/21, 2:31 am - +91 97018 27354: I'm wondering, how do they compute such scores? Teaching and curriculum score? Did they go through the curriculums of all 60 something programs? ü§î
26/11/21, 2:32 am - +1 (514) 974-0682: Why there is not even mentioned of our course in that list..
26/11/21, 2:36 am - +91 99116 67917: 40th number is our course place
26/11/21, 2:37 am - +91 99116 67917: Similarly News media work
26/11/21, 2:37 am - +91 97018 27354: It's there. 40 something. But teaching and curriculum score is higher than most. üòú

28/11/21, 7:09 pm - +91 98209 18938: U all using Google colab or Jupiter notebook for coding
28/11/21, 7:10 pm - +91 94529 09216: Mostly jupyter
28/11/21, 7:19 pm - +91 81060 40245: Colab - we no need to depend on any Laptop. Wherever you go , can work on any machine !!
29/11/21, 1:22 am - +91 89210 23935: I use jupyter notebook for most coding than collab mainly because of the responsiveness and  Notebook extensions with which you can do highlighting, get  execution time, code folding, variable explorer etc..
29/11/21, 7:07 am - +91 96665 85625: All these things are possible on colab too and it is getting better everyday
29/11/21, 9:17 am - +91 89210 23935: How can you add extensions in collab?
29/11/21, 9:29 am - +91 96665 85625: If you need extensions for highlighting and stuff here is what you can do

- For highlighting you can use html in the markdown
- Now there is a default menu on the left for variable explorer provided in colab
- I am not sure about code folding but the markdown sections can be folded

The advantages of colab are like you can access and run you notebooks from anywhere and you donot need to bother abou configuring all the things and since these are linux machines you will get habituated for them
29/11/21, 9:37 am - +91 89210 23935: It's getting improved. But personally, I don't like the delay of few seconds for getting the result of even simple calculations like 1+1.

There is an extension execution time in jupyter notebook. Once enabled, it gives execution time of every cells. It's useful to know which part of the code is taking more time and so on.
There is an extension to alert once the code has run. 
There are lot of extensions which extends the vanilla notebook experience.

The only reason that I use Collab is the network speed and their compute resources. I always like the snappy feel of jupyter notebooks and jupyter lab desktop app.
29/11/21, 9:38 am - +91 89210 23935: I find paperspace gradient faster than google colab.
29/11/21, 9:39 am - +91 89210 23935: It gives the native jupyter notebook experience and had extensions
29/11/21, 9:39 am - +91 89210 23935: Have*
29/11/21, 9:41 am - +91 88106 09909: What about using jupyter notebooks on vs code. How is it?
29/11/21, 9:42 am - +91 96394 70953: Hi all, I missed yesterday sessions anyone have any link of recordings? If anyone have please share thanks in advanceüôÇ
29/11/21, 9:45 am - +91 83329 81498: I do this. I use the insiders build. It's amazing.
29/11/21, 9:45 am - +91 83329 81498: The ui feels a bit lanky but you'll get used to it.
29/11/21, 9:46 am - +91 83329 81498: They said they'll be posted on the course page.
29/11/21, 9:47 am - +91 89210 23935: I had issues with auto complete on notebooks when I used vs code. But it is possible.

I like to use .py files with vs code. Other time I work with notebooks.

Simple codes with jupyter lab desktop app.
Small projects using jupyter notebooks.
Compute intensive tasks on cloud.
29/11/21, 9:47 am - +91 96394 70953: Ok thanks @918332981498

04/12/21, 8:49 pm - +91 78935 18350: I guess these sessions are intended for the Batch 1 students as they're about to complete thier Diploma in 2-3 months and get ready for job. These will be repeated again for us in the next semester I guess..it's not necessary for us right now but these are some helpful sessions who are in middle of job Search

04/12/21, 10:35 pm - +91 97018 27354: 9 AM? I thought it was 11 AM, that is what I heard today in the session.
04/12/21, 10:38 pm - +91 97018 27354: 1st batch students already finished the program. Only those who had issues are retaking some of the exams.
04/12/21, 10:39 pm - +91 99116 67917: any word on there placements?
04/12/21, 10:42 pm - +91 97018 27354: I also feel this is too much, given that most of us are working full time.
04/12/21, 10:43 pm - +91 97018 27354: No idea. They haven't published any list or statistics.
04/12/21, 10:43 pm - +91 97018 27354: All we see are the testimonials.
04/12/21, 10:43 pm - +91 70079 99702: They should publish it
04/12/21, 10:45 pm - +91 77748 96465: But placement will start after thesis right?
04/12/21, 10:45 pm - +91 70079 99702: They  should reveal how many students received the diploma degree also
04/12/21, 10:46 pm - +91 77748 96465: I think batch 1 will finish course in march
04/12/21, 10:46 pm - +91 97018 27354: Given the sample of testimonials and some repeat emails and their enrollment size that would be bad marketing! The success stories are few compared to clamed 10000+ enrollments in applied ai.
04/12/21, 10:47 pm - +91 97018 27354: Think or know for sure?
04/12/21, 10:47 pm - +91 77748 96465: Thats wat sir had told in one live session
04/12/21, 10:47 pm - +91 97018 27354: 1st batch started in 2020 Aug, so 2 sems thats 2021 July graduation.

04/12/21, 10:48 pm - +91 77748 96465: Course for batch 1 started in Feb 2021...how can they start placements in December 2021

04/12/21, 10:49 pm - +91 77748 96465: But are they giving testimonials of all students or they are doing for only few?
We dnt knw that
04/12/21, 10:49 pm - +91 97018 27354: I talked with few students of applied ai in bangalore via github/linkedin and found out that many don't finish the program. That's the main reason I joined the diploma, at least I'll have something to show for.
04/12/21, 10:51 pm - +91 77748 96465: I personally feel that...to finish the course u have do it full time...it's very detailed and big course ....
04/12/21, 10:51 pm - +91 97018 27354: you can get the tax records of a private ltd company, it's open data from ministry of corporate affairs. form the profits you can compute the enrollments to be easily above 10000+ and you can count the number of testimonials on their website and youtube. eazzy peazzy üòú

04/12/21, 11:22 pm - +91 97018 27354: When was this? Okay makes sense they have other offerings as well I didn't think about, coding, GATE, gov exams, etc. They are diversifying.
04/12/21, 11:22 pm - +91 90357 92877: This was in July I guess, pretty sure its more now

04/12/21, 11:26 pm - +91 90357 92877: But yeah, the course content is unmatched here, Ive heard its more in depth than some masters degree courses
04/12/21, 11:27 pm - +91 97018 27354: Still not as bad as Gyjus and poopGrad
04/12/21, 11:28 pm - +91 88640 27876: I agree applied ai course is very good
04/12/21, 11:28 pm - +65 8337 3637: And this is considerably cheaper
04/12/21, 11:28 pm - +91 88640 27876: Gyjus are scammer
04/12/21, 11:28 pm - +91 98209 18938: All these assignments compulsory?
04/12/21, 11:29 pm - +65 8337 3637: Well not sure on the Diploma
Those are not mandatory
But they are compulsory for the Applied AI course
If you want their placement assistance
04/12/21, 11:30 pm - +65 8337 3637: Never explored it.
04/12/21, 11:30 pm - +65 8337 3637: Khan Academy is good though
And YT videos are better than even some Udemy courses..
04/12/21, 11:31 pm - +91 97018 27354: try BrownHatJr üòÖ
04/12/21, 11:31 pm - +91 88640 27876: They are super scammer
04/12/21, 11:32 pm - +91 97018 27354: are we are talking abt Byjus Indian cricket team ka shirt dekh lo. That dude acts super Gay so I call him Gayjus/Gyjus.

04/12/21, 11:34 pm - +91 97018 27354: Venture/Vulture Capitalist
04/12/21, 11:40 pm - +91 97018 27354: Nice guy when playing football. He used to play football every evening in decathalon e-city back in 2016 when I met him. Now he is run like a puppet by managers from VC funds. Okayish content, shitty sales team/managers. Why would someone buy that when you have Khan Academy.
04/12/21, 11:56 pm - +91 97890 35993: Sales team... Have you listen to some audio clips on YouTube
05/12/21, 12:10 am - +91 97018 27354: Yes, I came across some clips/screenshots/texts when I followed the whole Gyjus vs Pradeep Poonia litigation fiasco earlier this year. Their employees are very sanskari and vinamra to say the least. üôÉ

05/12/21, 8:58 am - +91 83329 81498: I'm joining the entity embedding session. Vikram Anand sessions are kinda boring.

05/12/21, 9:16 am - +91 99116 67917: Any ongoing class?
05/12/21, 9:18 am - +91 97018 27354: Basics of LSTM, BERT. He is assuming.
05/12/21, 9:18 am - +91 97018 27354: I'm leaving.
05/12/21, 9:18 am - +91 99116 67917: What happened?
05/12/21, 9:19 am - +91 97018 27354: I don't know deep learning, yet.
05/12/21, 9:19 am - +91 97018 27354: This is not for us yet, I guess.
05/12/21, 9:20 am - +91 75690 61914: Link provided in this email is redirecting to entity embedding session not to Vikram Anand sirs session
05/12/21, 9:20 am - +91 99116 67917: So this will be conducted in future for us or will it be recorded session?
05/12/21, 9:21 am - +91 97018 27354: He just said, this will be recorded and put in videos section.
05/12/21, 9:21 am - +91 99116 67917: üëçüëçüëç
05/12/21, 9:24 am - +91 97018 27354: Am I the only one who is annoyed by such poor communication regarding announcements. I just sent my driver to take my Mom to Hospital. Just stayed for the session and attendance. üòû
05/12/21, 9:28 am - +65 8337 3637: Me too. Have decided to skip most if not all live sessions.
Not worth it. Will watch recorded sessions later whenever they put up.
If they do not put up - then it was meant for us
05/12/21, 9:30 am - +91 96184 80572: Better to send a mail to the team asking to send mails on live sessions which are only meant for batch 2
05/12/21, 9:33 am - +91 90324 45343: Not gonna happen, as there may be few in batch 2 who are already DS/ML gonna benefit out of these..
05/12/21, 9:33 am - +91 96184 80572: Ok üëç
05/12/21, 9:36 am - +91 99599 32345: Lot of instances, there was a poor communication. I think we have to write a mail to them to communicate things better going forward.
05/12/21, 9:42 am - +91 83329 81498: to be fair, in the announcement video, they said pre reqs are deep learning and word embeddings
05/12/21, 9:44 am - +91 97110 42979: I think these sessions are for 1st bath ..as there prerequisite are different......they add us in this session....course goin to another direction
05/12/21, 9:46 am - +91 99165 48094: If this communication of prerequisite would have been mentioned in mail it would have been way better.
05/12/21, 9:47 am - +91 80950 04680: What made them transition to 2-days session over the weekend??When I had checked with applied roots before applying they said classes will be conducted on one weekend... Now last week a day long session then this week 2 days session...
05/12/21, 10:12 am - +91 89210 23935: Okk I only missed embedding session.. üòÖ Vikram sir's session at 11? Same link?
05/12/21, 10:15 am - +91 89210 23935: Okay.. no session. Back to sleep
05/12/21, 10:19 am - +91 99998 58727: True
05/12/21, 10:20 am - +91 99998 58727: Same üòÑ

05/12/21, 11:04 am - +91 97018 27354: I have already emailed them 1 month ago regarding the same, they replied - stick with status quo. I guess they will act when they have "data". Let's all send them at least 20-30 emails, maybe they will listen.
05/12/21, 11:05 am - +91 99599 32345: Yes Lets send
05/12/21, 11:05 am - +91 97018 27354: I checked slack, there was an email regarding the canceled session. I didn't receive that email.
05/12/21, 11:07 am - +91 97018 27354: I also didn't receive the classroom/assignment portal email.
05/12/21, 11:12 am - +91 96184 80572: We can also mention that few of us are receiving emails while others are not
05/12/21, 11:13 am - +91 99998 58727: Yeah let‚Äôs mail we are getting emails late, lots of miscommunication, no classroom email etc. sab likhdo üòÑ
05/12/21, 11:30 am - +91 97018 27354: Please sab log thoda reqst karo.
05/12/21, 11:31 am - +91 97018 27354: Dear Sir/Madam,

It appears there is a consensus building up on the WhatsApp student group that the 1st test would cover Foundational Maths and Elements of AI (including SQL), however the official Google Docs schedule reads only week 1-6(which excludes SQL and Maths) will be covered. I missed the last 2 live sessions so I might be missing something, please let me know which is it? Is the official Google Doc file not up to date? (--ISSUE--)

Please forward one suggestion to Varma Sir; if we could have a course wiki/page, so that there are no issues regarding course logistics and administration. Ideally, there should be no scope of any issues for something that trivial. The WA group is overwhelming(no indexing or search feature), Slack is nice but not being used effectively. Google Doc URLs are not memorable(no way to tell when was it last updated unless explicitly mentioned)!
Here are some examples -
https://cs61a.org/
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/
I can help/volunteer for this if required, maintain a repo and host it on services like render/github(free). Can have a simple URL like uoh-aiml.render.com or uoh-aiml.github.io.
This should not take more than 15-30 minutes to setup.

Hope you will consider this matter.

Best,
SG (7th Nov)

05/12/21, 11:28 pm - +91 72648 49874: Nope. Out of 4000+ hardly 2-4% finish it. Only for these does AppliedAiCourse provide placement assistance. More or less this is same as any other institution.
05/12/21, 11:31 pm - +91 98209 18938: Only 4% completed?
05/12/21, 11:31 pm - +91 98209 18938: Very less then
05/12/21, 11:32 pm - +91 98209 18938: You are scaring me
05/12/21, 11:32 pm - +91 88988 90243: Where did you get this number?
05/12/21, 11:50 pm - +91 88640 27876: Just think, those 4% are now in elite club!!! Another motivation to complete this course even in 1.5 years
05/12/21, 11:51 pm - +91 88640 27876: Mathematics may be scary for most of them!
05/12/21, 11:54 pm - +91 72648 49874: if you do some research on LinkedIn and Telegram groups you'll find all those details and then approximate it further.
05/12/21, 11:57 pm - +91 72648 49874: it is not about mathematics. in the industry people are looking for problem solvers and not necessarily PhDs in applied mathematics. The ones who completed the AppliedAiCourse are good in implementation because of the mandatory assignments they ask to submit.
05/12/21, 11:59 pm - +91 88640 27876: What is your opinion for diploma program? There is no such mandatory assignments
05/12/21, 11:59 pm - +91 72648 49874: i don't know yet since we have not seen mandatory assignments, but there are optional assignments available in Classroom as of now. I am sure they will release mandatory assignments also...
06/12/21, 12:28 am - +91 98933 88933: I've completed applied ai course, the optional assignments added here are the mandatory assignments in applied ai course, so these will be helpful in career transition
06/12/21, 12:28 am - +91 98933 88933: I learnt a lot from these assignments

06/12/21, 8:24 am - +65 8337 3637: Some studies show the infection this variant inflicts is on the mild side

06/12/21, 10:23 am - +91 98933 88933: Honestly, I'm just an average guy, it is all due to AAIC content, persistent effort and God's grace that I got placed

06/12/21, 11:47 am - +91 98933 88933: The optional assignments added in the appliedroots classroom are the same as mandatory assignments in AAIC, rest of the assignments present in LMS are unique to Diploma program, whatever sir said is correct, Diploma is a superset of AAIC
06/12/21, 11:52 am - +91 98933 88933: Prob. was tough as I'm from a CS background, I read through the comment section of AAIC to get clarity on concepts (it's quite large in AAIC), searched on net for blogs/videos for concepts I didn't understand, asked in the query section, one resource that I like is "StatsQuest" on Youtube, also, prob. is a massive topic, anyone can't get it in one go, whatever you can understand now is okay, try to rewatch the videos and see if it makes better sense, still if things aren't very clear, they'll get clear as you'll see things being used in ML, as sir says, move in a BFS fashion than DFS

If something in the course content is not clear, ask that query immediately, otherwise don't go to deep, these are very big areas
06/12/21, 12:05 pm - +91 99865 79062: Thanks for your suggestions/inputs
06/12/21, 12:07 pm - +61 435 080 700: Aaha.. clear now..thanks alot..all the best wishes..
06/12/21, 12:10 pm - +91 93151 01542: So according to you which course is best based on assignment diploma or appliedai
06/12/21, 12:18 pm - +91 72648 49874: exact and very nice strategy.

And I also conversed with Srikanth sir before joining this course about course content so he told it‚Äôs a superset. So, ultimately it is more than applied ai course.
06/12/21, 2:19 pm - +91 94882 02727: For AAIC? Is the curriculum that large that it took on an average 4.2hrs/day for 12 months?
06/12/21, 2:31 pm - +91 90324 45343: Sir said 10-12 hrs per week, I guess it is not all possible
06/12/21, 2:32 pm - +91 90324 45343: Not sure if he included live lectures
06/12/21, 2:34 pm - +91 70877 58526: It takes me double, sometimes more than double the time the video lectures
06/12/21, 2:35 pm - +91 70877 58526: So that's why I am behind the scheduleüòÖ

06/12/21, 6:33 pm - +91 97018 27354: Crypto? Not worth the risk. Current political situation is bad to put it mildly, they are using UAPA for anything and everything. Put your money in US index funds weekly/monthly to avg. out the price like ICICI offerings in India(why? year after year dollar and euro growing against rupee, why not grow in USD) and commercial Real estate in tier 2-3 cities if you can, there are pool offerings by 2-3 companies.
06/12/21, 6:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: Are you saying that there is possible ban on cryptos using UAPA?
06/12/21, 6:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: I am unaware of crypto news, but they are going down
06/12/21, 6:39 pm - +91 89210 23935: So thought it would be a good time to invest because after going down, it always went up. Now it is down.
06/12/21, 6:40 pm - +91 89210 23935: Or gamble whichever is appropriate

06/12/21, 6:53 pm - +91 97018 27354: You must be knowing about the cordon searches goin on daily in Hyderabad(Telengana/Andra)+BLR. These searches are unlawful but still gov/police are doing it. Without reason or warrant you might be asked to open your phone so that they can access your photos/emails/apps, etc. They just need any stupid reason to cause problems. UAPA laga do -> He was moneylaundering or what have you. From what I understand the current bill says private crypto will be banned, which technically means private chain assets like monero, zcash, etc. but God only knows how our officers will interpret the bill and act.
06/12/21, 6:55 pm - +91 97018 27354: BY NO MEANS I AM AN EXPERT, DO YOUR OWN REAEARCH! I will only say diversify to mitigate any risk. If you plan on getting into crypto that shouldn't be more than 5-10% of your total portfolio, don't just bank on crypto.
06/12/21, 6:58 pm - +91 97018 27354: Plus the risk of losing keys, if you keep your tokens on exchanges. DON'T KEEP ANYTHING ON EXCHANGES, GET A HARDWARE WALLET OR AIRGAPPED COMPUTER.

08/12/21, 6:21 pm - +91 83300 49953: Here while calculating expected value of x, you are doing  2 * 2/4 + 2* 2/4 + 4*2/4  + 4*2/4. But actually we have to multiply only for each  distinct value of x because we are multiplying with p(x) . That is 2* 2/4  + 4* 2/4
08/12/21, 6:21 pm - +91 87008 71097: In 1) you have to do 2*(2/4) + 2*(2/4) it is the frequency not the number
08/12/21, 6:22 pm - +91 87008 71097: Similarly for the others

08/12/21, 6:33 pm - +91 89727 71985: Ahh! Got it now, so we are doing summation over all distinct values of X not all values of X
08/12/21, 6:34 pm - +91 89727 71985: Hm.. interesting! Do we have a formula to calculate the frequency of a value of a Variable?
08/12/21, 6:50 pm - +91 89727 71985: But this doesn't solve my 2nd question tho! even if we consider distinct values of X - the general formula of Var(X) will give => 0.5 and E[(x-Œº)^2] formula gives us => 1 -- which one is correct and why?
08/12/21, 6:50 pm - +91 78756 85040: One trick could be one should check sum of  all p(x) value must be 1
08/12/21, 6:53 pm - +91 89727 71985: üëçüèº noted.
08/12/21, 6:55 pm - +91 78756 85040: I guess Probability of occurrence of same event (in this case occurence of 2 and 4) must not be counted twice.
08/12/21, 6:56 pm - +91 78756 85040: That's contrary to axioms of probability if I'm not wrong
08/12/21, 7:01 pm - +91 89727 71985: P(S) = 1 and event has to be unique and disjoint I believe to satisfy the 3rd property.
08/12/21, 7:10 pm - +91 78756 85040: S={2, 2, 4, 4} 
X: 2's in S
Y:4's in S
X and Y could be Disjoint sets.
Correct me if I m wrong
08/12/21, 7:17 pm - +91 89727 71985: Yes, X and Y are disjoint but 2 and 2 or 4 and 4 can't be disjoint - which is the mistake I've made. That's what I mentioned above, anyway got your point.

08/12/21, 7:33 pm - +49 179 4111257: Guys, are those optional videos are mandatory to finish? Of course Tableau is important. But my question is are those also under exam syllabus?
08/12/21, 7:35 pm - +91 78756 85040: Okay Here As you can see in both assumptions (distinct and non distinct case)  Variance value is twice as that calculated by formula.
08/12/21, 7:38 pm - +91 78756 85040: So again same thing applies in case of variance that probability of occurrence of same event shouldn't counted twice. You can check it by formula
E(X-Mu¬≤) = E(X¬≤) - mu¬≤
08/12/21, 7:38 pm - +91 91762 75222: Would like to fill a table with 1's and 0's such that number of 1s in a row should be >30% of cells and number of 1s in a column should be <40% of cells.

 No.of rows and columns are not fixed and may vary.
 In case if we can't able to achieve on all rows and columns then we can compromise on few of rows or columns.

08/12/21, 7:55 pm - +91 78756 85040: Variance should be 1 in this case

11/12/21, 4:42 pm - +91 99116 67917: Although they say this will not be recorded, I believe if the same person will be there during the second semester then the same content will be discussed, or maybe a better version of the same content will be discussed. Currently, they are mainly focused on 1st Batch Recruitment so they are conducting these seminars. Maybe similar seminars will be conducted to our batch and access will be given to the 3rd or future batches at that moment. - (Just an opinion)

11/12/21, 4:52 pm - +91 88988 90243: Do we have second chance to attend it?
11/12/21, 4:53 pm - +91 70877 58526: I don't know about that, it might be possible that they conduct this thing for 2 batches simultaneously cause obviously why pay more for same thing an year later.

11/12/21, 5:04 pm - +91 99116 67917: This could be possible but then in future we can demand for guests lectures for academics as well as job preparation as they told us that these things will be available to us from 2nd semester.

14/12/21, 11:33 am - +91 73825 54571: Can anyone say why we use quantiles
14/12/21, 11:39 am - +91 94529 09216: So basically quantities are
Q1 = 25 percentile
Q 2 = 50 percentile 
Q 3 = 75 percentile.
We mainly use quantiles with pdf , to get the sense, what percentage of data lies in given quantile range
14/12/21, 11:42 am - +91 94529 09216: E.g. suppose you gave CAT , exam, and here you don't get marks in percentage, but in percentile only, so that they have clear sense, how many people are behind you and how many candidates are ahead of you

14/12/21, 11:43 am - +91 94529 09216: Let say I got 75 percentile, it doesn't mean I scored 75 percentage of marks, but it only means I am ahead of 75 percent of candidates

15/12/21, 12:40 pm - +61 435 080 700: Hello Guys..
Did u understand hypothesis testing for coin flip..

Probability of (heads in 5 times coin is flipped, given coin is not biased) = 3% 
--indicates coin is biased

But if 3 times flipped = 12.5% --coin is not biased

As the number of flips increases, results will say coin is biased.. anybody understood this? Can someone explain this please..
15/12/21, 12:48 pm - +91 90388 76605: H0= coin is not biased towards heads.
H1=coin is biased towards heads
First time toss :Head
Probability of head=1/2
2nd time again head. P=1/2*1/2
3rd time again head p=1/2*1/2*1/2=1/8=12.5%
But standard limit is assumed to be 5%. So we are still not sure whether the coin is biased or not
So we will toss again: again head. It's probability 12.5%/2
Still greater than 5%
.....
5th time toss again head probability around 3% or 1/32
Which is less than 5%.
So now we can be assured that if the coin was unbiased the probability of getting 5 heads in 5 tosses would have been very rare or almost 3%. So our initial assumption is wrong and the coin is biased.
15/12/21, 1:03 pm - +61 435 080 700: Thank you for the explanation.
For some reason I still can not understand it.Sorry.üòü
Even if I am flipping with a unbiased coin, I will get the same results.right?
15/12/21, 1:04 pm - +91 90388 76605: Yes you will get the same results. But for a unbiased coin getting 5/5 heads consecutively will have probability of 3%
15/12/21, 1:05 pm - +91 90388 76605: While if the coin was fully biased towards heads.. getting 5/5 will be 1
15/12/21, 1:05 pm - +91 90388 76605: Or 100%
15/12/21, 1:11 pm - +61 435 080 700: So unbiased on 5/5 heads is 3% ,

Fully biased coin 5/5 heads is 100%,

Partially biased in btw 3% to 100. %

In the above case, we saw the probability is 3% , but why the end assumption is coin is biased?
15/12/21, 1:11 pm - +61 435 080 700: Sorry..it may be stupid question
15/12/21, 1:11 pm - +91 96505 18893: Even if the coin is biased towards head the probability of getting all heads will be high but i do not think it will be 100%‚Ä¶ since flipping coin is matter of chance. 100% probability is when both side of the coin will be heads.
15/12/21, 1:12 pm - +91 90388 76605: Suppose both the sides are heads. Talking something like that
15/12/21, 1:14 pm - +91 96505 18893: This message was deleted
15/12/21, 1:15 pm - +91 96505 18893: There are two situations:
1) coin is not baised
2) coin is baised towards head
In first situation probability of getting head is exactly 50%
In second situation it is difficult to tell the probability of getting head‚Ä¶ but we are sure that it is more than 50%
15/12/21, 1:16 pm - +91 90388 76605: You have to think something like if the coin was unbiased the probability of getting 5 heads out of 5 is 3%...which is very very rare. So you can assume that there is something wrong with the coin.
15/12/21, 1:17 pm - +91 90388 76605: But if you tossed only once and you get a head, and I tell you bro the coin is biased will you believe me?
15/12/21, 1:17 pm - +61 435 080 700: Nope
15/12/21, 1:18 pm - +91 90388 76605: Or you tossed 5 times, got head 5 times, then if I tell you bro the coin is biased , then will you believe me?
15/12/21, 1:18 pm - +61 435 080 700: I mightüòÉüòÉ
15/12/21, 1:19 pm - +91 90388 76605: Yes...that is what hypothesis testing is all about. First sir told getting heads 3 times out of 3 times...then 5 times out of 5
15/12/21, 1:19 pm - +91 96505 18893: Lets say one of your friend says that the coin is unbaised and then he flips the coin one time gets head ‚Ä¶ nothing fishy
Then again and then again‚Ä¶
By fifth time you will start having doubt on the coin‚Äôs biasness ‚Ä¶ 
Because flipping coin is in front of your eyes so doubting the result of 5 heads will be out of question
15/12/21, 1:20 pm - +91 90388 76605: Now add statistical jargons to this ..and some hefty terms...you are done
15/12/21, 1:21 pm - +91 96505 18893: So untill the number of trails are enough u will not doubt the coin‚Äôs biasness
15/12/21, 1:22 pm - +61 435 080 700: Okies..now it's somewhat clear..
I have a long way to goo..

15/12/21, 1:25 pm - +91 90388 76605: Right. Then it will make more sense... getting 5 out of 5
15/12/21, 1:25 pm - +91 96505 18893: Coz probability definition says that there should be infinite trials

15/12/21, 1:27 pm - +91 96505 18893: 5 is a very small number so we cannot state the probability of head based on this..
15/12/21, 1:28 pm - +91 90388 76605: True. But in real world getting infinite trials is also not possible. I was just emphasising on his example.
15/12/21, 1:29 pm - +91 96505 18893: That is why probability of getting head 100% is only possible when there is no other option‚Ä¶
15/12/21, 1:30 pm - +91 90388 76605: Right
15/12/21, 1:30 pm - +91 96505 18893: Getting 5 heads in 5 trails does not imply 100% probability.

15/12/21, 8:23 pm - +65 8337 3637: I believe even when sir says Uni is setting the paper, it seemed - to me- to be set by Applied Roots
15/12/21, 8:24 pm - +65 8337 3637: You can try and raise it to the team
15/12/21, 8:24 pm - +91 97396 15111: Yeah will try from my end

15/12/21, 9:25 pm - +91 97396 15111: Dear Sir/ Madam,

This is a request to postpone the 2nd Mid term exam which is scheduled on 26th Dec.
Since it's festival time for some of us, it's going to be difficult to concentrate on the exam and studies.

If it is possible could the exam be postponed to a later date?

Thanks and regards,

16/12/21, 10:15 am - +91 98933 88933: Hi all, I mailed the team regarding notes and other materials (resume templates etc.) of Mr. Vikram Anand's sessions, they sent me this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hH7vWKhmOjNX__1ToTtPN2nuQfRp0B6Q
Currently only Session 1 and 2 notes are there but they said they'll add rest of the notes soon
Since I've attended all of the sessions, I can assure that almost all of the content covered in the sessions is present in the notes
So for all who've missed the sessions, this can be helpful

16/12/21, 11:50 am - +91 73825 54571: Can anyone clear me 
Why cdf has both continuous and discrete curves and why pmf has no contious and we use pdf for that
16/12/21, 11:50 am - +91 73825 54571: Pls fill me where im laging
16/12/21, 11:52 am - +91 70877 58526: Discrete random variable can have only a finite number of values it can take and thus pmf used to represent the probability would not look continuous.
16/12/21, 11:53 am - +91 70877 58526: You can think as number of values of a discrete random variable approaches infinity the pmf will start to look like pdf.
16/12/21, 11:56 am - +91 73825 54571: Ok
16/12/21, 11:56 am - +91 73825 54571: Cool
16/12/21, 11:57 am - +91 70877 58526: Did it solve your doubt?
16/12/21, 11:57 am - +91 73825 54571: Yes
16/12/21, 12:07 pm - +91 73825 54571: In pmf we find probabilities of events
In pdf we use frequencies to find probabilities of events
Now cdf is combination of both
16/12/21, 12:10 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think it's just a naming convention ,
 pmf for discrete values
 and
pdf for continuous values
16/12/21, 12:13 pm - +91 73825 54571: Yes
16/12/21, 12:14 pm - +91 73825 54571: Shubham
16/12/21, 2:03 pm - +91 95603 55228: did you get any reply from applied root?  i did not get any reply till now.
16/12/21, 2:05 pm - +91 97396 15111: yeah
16/12/21, 2:05 pm - +91 97396 15111: Hi Steffy,

We understand but unfortunately, it is not possible as per the current schedule. The dates were decided by the university and there is no changing them for any reasons. We would like to remind you that missing this exam due to any reason, will make you ineligible to write the end semester exam for the subject as well. You will have to then repeat this subject alone along with the next batch. So, we suggest that you plan things smartly to be able to write it now itself.

Thanks,
Applied Roots Team

18/12/21, 1:06 pm - +91 95582 32982: The main problem from the video is i can't connect the dots. How individual videos are connected to each others

18/12/21, 1:45 pm - +61 435 080 700: When u watch first time u might not understand..try to watch multiple times..go breadth don't go in depth..statquest is one YouTube channel u can check..for concepts like conditional probability.

18/12/21, 1:55 pm - +91 73825 54571: U learn the topics, where u think u cant connect..search ur query on google or youtube...
Learn keywords meanings.this might help u
18/12/21, 1:59 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yeah agreed. Even in probability the videos are not properly structured and have various other references that sir introduces but we don‚Äôt have video‚Ä¶
18/12/21, 2:00 pm - +91 96505 18893: I used to teach IGCSE students‚Ä¶ they had statistics book 1 and book 2 for A level maths ‚Ä¶ most of the concepts taught by sir are covered in those books‚Ä¶ 
Course books for school students are better organised. So think they help us understand better plus they have exercises at end of each topic. Sir‚Äôs videos make the concepts easier but only if u have some prior idea.

Now given the case is die will be rolled only if it is 1,2 or 3.
So divide the combination of numbers 1,2 or 3 by total combinations

25/12/21, 5:46 am - +91 96666 32574: We will divide by 36...if there are 36 elements in sample space...and each element is equally likely...but our case there are 21 elements in sample space....with 3 elements with 1/6 probability and other elements with 1/18 probability.... I don't understand the solution...??

25/12/21, 11:26 am - +91 99998 58727: That‚Äôs is the problem with some old professors buddy. Everyone has gone through this university professors teaching 

They have extensive knowledge but how to deliver their knowledge their these people struggle!
25/12/21, 11:27 am - +91 88640 27876: Listen to lecture man!

25/12/21, 6:37 pm - +91 70877 58526: This is a problem as we understand in height difference video, we mixed the class students to simulate null hypothesis of no difference in height but here we are mixing the patients and that doesn't effect the drugs, so the hypothesis defined here doesn't follow or basically have no effect on general hypothesis criteria where we reject Ho when pvalue is less than alpha

27/12/21, 5:04 am - +91 89210 23935: Confusion is in the video only.. I got better understanding when you asked that question. Thank you.
27/12/21, 5:09 am - +91 88988 90243: In one of the interviews, I explained that We have used outlier detection in one of our projects using avg+k*std

Next question from interviewer : did your data follow normal distribution? 

My answer: no

Interviewer : then your application is wrong

My answer: but our outputs were correct and up to the mark

Hope I knew chebyshevs inequality earlier. üòÖ
27/12/21, 5:13 am - +91 89210 23935: Also sir explained in few videos earlier that if the kurtosis is high, probably there is an outlier problem
27/12/21, 5:15 am - +91 89210 23935: I'm wondering if chebyshev's inequality holds true for very skewed distributions as well.. it feels like magic üòÖ
27/12/21, 5:15 am - +91 88988 90243: I checked with few examples
It works
27/12/21, 5:16 am - +91 88988 90243: Formula was bouncer for me, 
But to summarise, 
Kurtosis measures tailed ness of distribution and skewness identifies if the distribution is left or right skewed
27/12/21, 5:17 am - +91 89210 23935: Right üëç

27/12/21, 12:22 pm - +91 91131 88923: Yes course-5 we haven't completed. 
I think by mistake they have send us.
27/12/21, 12:22 pm - +91 77748 96465: And we haven't yet finished 2nd
27/12/21, 12:22 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ya
27/12/21, 12:22 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually it might be for batch 1
27/12/21, 12:22 pm - +91 94529 09216: Not for us
27/12/21, 12:23 pm - +91 94529 09216: By mistake they send it to both batches

27/12/21, 1:00 pm - +91 99998 58727: Can someone confirm we have 3 assignments as of now and are they mandatory?
27/12/21, 1:00 pm - +91 89715 68712: Same here. For working professionals, this course is sort of complicated i feel. I yet have to finish PCA and stuff
27/12/21, 1:01 pm - +91 99998 58727: Right‚Ä¶ 
I‚Äôm on applied probability and stats section
27/12/21, 1:07 pm - +91 89715 68712: üòÇ senior than me then

27/12/21, 1:12 pm - +91 70877 58526: I just finished PCA, I was looking forward to all the mathematical part but it ended with not so much in depth of knowledge. S
27/12/21, 1:18 pm - +91 99998 58727: Stat quest has good video on PCA explanation
27/12/21, 1:19 pm - +91 99998 58727: Before end sem we have to complete isn‚Äôt?
27/12/21, 1:35 pm - +91 77748 96465: They haven't yet told Abt it...only thing they said is it will be optional....so I dnt think there will be deadline..it's just for practice I guess
27/12/21, 1:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think we will revisit PCA when we learn matrix factorisation for recommender systems
27/12/21, 1:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: When we learn singular value decomposition
27/12/21, 1:37 pm - +91 88640 27876: It's very complicated man
27/12/21, 1:40 pm - +91 88640 27876: yesterday I asked them that I why they didn't explain coding part in most of the video's they told me do it yourself
27/12/21, 1:41 pm - +91 88640 27876: Now if i will sit to write each code , I will have to resign from my present job
27/12/21, 1:41 pm - +91 88640 27876: to pursue this distance learning program ü§£
27/12/21, 1:42 pm - +91 77748 96465: But u have to write code on your own...if u have to get good at it
It's all about practice..but I understand ur situation....12-14hrs per week is not sufficient for most of the ppl
27/12/21, 1:43 pm - +91 77748 96465: 12hrs are enough just to go through weeks content...but thn revision and coding part is not possible
27/12/21, 1:44 pm - +91 88640 27876: that is why I am telling for working professional and for non cs background , this course should  for2 years
27/12/21, 1:44 pm - +61 435 080 700: End of semester..after mid term 3
27/12/21, 1:46 pm - +91 79806 28509: One suggestion, as of now you can focus on MCQ for mid term 2 , for coding, it is mandatory to submit b4 last day of sem 1, so can be done even after 3rd mid term exam, we'll get nearly one month post 3rd mid term exam
27/12/21, 1:46 pm - +91 78756 85040: +1
27/12/21, 1:47 pm - +61 435 080 700: Is there anybody lost track after probability..

27/12/21, 1:48 pm - +91 78756 85040: And Haberman's Cancer dataset
27/12/21, 1:48 pm - +91 78756 85040: Isn't mandatory
27/12/21, 1:48 pm - +91 79806 28509: End of feb, and sem 1 exam - end of March
27/12/21, 1:48 pm - +91 77748 96465: Is this assignment added for us?

27/12/21, 1:57 pm - +91 83418 08163: That's heavy dedication
27/12/21, 1:57 pm - +91 79806 28509: I guess, after september- oct, when sem 2 ends, there will be interviews & placements..

27/12/21, 2:05 pm - +91 96505 18893: I think they want you to understand Mathematics part ‚Ä¶ and then they will get to the coding in course 3 ‚Ä¶
27/12/21, 2:10 pm - +91 88640 27876: ohh it ?

27/12/21, 8:10 pm - +91 89210 23935: So from sorted values, you need to find the top (k/100)th value right?
27/12/21, 8:11 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Thanks
27/12/21, 8:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: So I thought of using value at k/100 th index as percentile
27/12/21, 8:11 pm - +91 94529 09216: Not top just kth value
27/12/21, 8:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: For percentile you have to sort forst
27/12/21, 8:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: for percentiles and medians
27/12/21, 8:12 pm - +91 89210 23935: Median is 50th percentile

27/12/21, 8:17 pm - +91 89210 23935: IQR problem
27/12/21, 8:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: This solution got better when I used round instead of int. Maybe you can try with floor or ceil if it makes sense.
27/12/21, 8:30 pm - +91 73825 54571: Yeah
27/12/21, 8:31 pm - +91 73825 54571: You r asking  IQR?
27/12/21, 8:31 pm - +91 73825 54571: I got it
27/12/21, 8:32 pm - +91 73825 54571: I cudnt get same percentile  values for builtin and without builtin

28/12/21, 12:14 am - +91 72648 49874: Additional study agar time plan kiya to achche se. Ek time nikalo din mein when you can concentrate most. Use that time to learn.

28/12/21, 11:34 am - +91 82522 38359: How is the quality of  courses of ineuron as compared to applied roots
28/12/21, 11:36 am - +91 70877 58526: I once purchased the ineuron course for deep learning, I never finished it but they don't explain the maths part that much in depth, they would provide all the equations and everything though.
They are more focused on implementation part.
28/12/21, 11:36 am - +91 88988 90243: applied roots indepth ( Theory+coding)
I have purchased i neuron also last week
They are more hands on
28/12/21, 11:40 am - +91 96666 32574: I have two courses of ineuron...applied Roots is far better than ineuron...ineuron videos are huge and revisting them becomes difficult and their content is live class recordings...I don't like personally don't enjoy revisting the videos..srikanth sir explains far better than ineuron team

28/12/21, 3:48 pm - +91 89210 23935: I wished it follow pareto distribution and followed 80-20 rule. Wished 80% problems took 20% time üòÖ

28/12/21, 4:18 pm - +91 98209 18938: Which 120 question
28/12/21, 4:18 pm - +91 96184 80572: Okay. Thanks
28/12/21, 4:19 pm - +91 96184 80572: I was referring to the practice questions in 21.21 and 27.9 chapters
28/12/21, 4:21 pm - +91 95370 26661: Hey guys this might be a repetitive question, but can anyone comment on the placement for our previous batch? Like what's their status, kab chalu hoga statistics etc etc?

28/12/21, 4:47 pm - +91 88640 27876: Abhi tak to machine learning ka koi chapter bhi shuru nhi hya hai
28/12/21, 4:53 pm - +91 95370 26661: I have my own reasons to ask so kindly share if you have any idea. (Or contact with someone from our previous batch)
28/12/21, 4:58 pm - +91 96184 80572: I think we can ask Srikanth sir during live session. Knowing it would give us confidence on the placement situation of diploma students.
28/12/21, 5:00 pm - +91 98933 88933: Prev. batch is just 1 semester ahead of us, sir told in the live session that their 2nd sem is going on right now (that's why we received that cnn assignment mail), they'll have placements in mar-apr timeframe
28/12/21, 5:00 pm - +91 96184 80572: Oh okay
28/12/21, 5:02 pm - +91 72181 64871: Yes, right.
28/12/21, 5:17 pm - +91 95370 26661: Thank you.
28/12/21, 7:59 pm - +91 72648 49874: True. lots of projects are there in iNeuron which covers End 2 end applications. of course their teaching capability is not like Shrikanth. but their notes in form of iPython notebooks is also great. What I like about this OTT platform is lifetime subscription for all existing and to-be courses for merely 7000/- INR.
28/12/21, 8:11 pm - +65 8337 3637: Is it not annual? And then would be subject to changes??
28/12/21, 8:21 pm - +91 72648 49874: It is annual if you enroll after 15th jan. Else lifetime at same price. üòé

28/12/21, 10:40 pm - +91 81445 54148: Or we can ignore for them now
28/12/21, 10:42 pm - +91 81445 54148: *them for now

28/12/21, 10:43 pm - +65 8337 3637: Usually optional shid be out. First mid term had one basic question on MongoDB though..

I would think it is safe to ignore Optional content..

29/12/21, 8:29 am - +91 91762 75222: I don't know Why you guys felt Prof CR Rao class is not good

 comparing with faculties of Indian colleges, Prof CR Rao is much much better, 
He is teaching very good

We can use That video as like revision for us

i hope you guys are doing good.

A few days ago,I had an accident,got elbow fracture in right hand 
Since we have exam on 2 nd January.
My preparation is not good.

What should I do?
1. Should I skip the exam? And if I skip When can I retake?

Any advice/ suggestions would be helpful.
29/12/21, 10:02 am - +65 8337 3637: Hey Ashish
Hope you are doing better!!

Appear for the exam - there is no passing requirement on this but attendance is mandatory.
Tend to your health first but do make sure u just attend the exam

29/12/21, 10:03 am - +65 8337 3637: The mandatory clause is - if u dont take mid term, you will not be allowed to take sem end for this subject
29/12/21, 10:03 am - +91 77748 96465: Bro it depends on ur situation..if u  feel u can perform decently and if ur condition allows you to sit for exam u should go for it..else u can skip...but please remember if u skip mid term exam then u won't be able to answer semester exam for course 2.
Wishing you speedy recovery...take care
29/12/21, 10:04 am - +65 8337 3637: Also, just appear for mock - try to understand the solutions. Hopefully the questions would be similar and we are able to perform better

29/12/21, 7:37 pm - +91 75690 61914: If I'm not wrong, not writing mid1 exam for subject 1 doesn't make you ineligible for complete sem1 exams, I guess you are not allowed to write only subject 1 semester exam. You will be promoted to next semester and where you will have backlog of subject 1, you need to clear that subject with next batch just like how we write normal semester exams during our graduation.
29/12/21, 7:41 pm - +91 96505 18893: Yes i think you can give statistics exam ‚Ä¶ u are not eligible for end sem exam of Essentials of AI
29/12/21, 7:42 pm - +91 94529 09216: Even I think the same. Because as per ugc norms, you will be given chance to appear in exam next time
29/12/21, 7:43 pm - +91 94529 09216: And sir told that you can complete this program in 2 years

29/12/21, 7:44 pm - +91 94529 09216: And it doesn't mean that , if you were absent in one exam ,then you have will sit down for this year and start the program next year
29/12/21, 7:45 pm - +91 96505 18893: +1
29/12/21, 7:45 pm - +91 94529 09216: I mean you can continue the program with 1 active backlog

29/12/21, 10:11 pm - +91 81445 54148: One doubt on the hat problem related to axiom of probability : 

Why we say p(E1 U E2U E3...En) will lead to probability of atleast one person
29/12/21, 10:16 pm - +977 984-5864046: At least one but can be E1, E2 ...En also
29/12/21, 10:16 pm - +91 94529 09216: p(E1 U E2U E3...En) = sample space
29/12/21, 10:17 pm - +91 94529 09216: Which is nothing but combination of all possible outcome
29/12/21, 10:17 pm - +977 984-5864046: {1,2,3,4,5} choose at least one number , { 1,2} {1,2,3} all are at least one
29/12/21, 10:17 pm - +91 94529 09216: So, atleast one event will occur for sure
29/12/21, 10:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: And most importantly, we read  p(E1 U E2U E3...En) as probability of E1 OR E2 OR E3 OR...En
29/12/21, 10:23 pm - +91 81445 54148: Thanks guys
30/12/21, 10:00 am - +91 73825 54571: It is OR but we use U in probs
30/12/21, 10:50 am - +91 78756 85040: It's just a union of sets that's all it is.
Let's say we have two events E1 and E2 and E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive and exhaustive 
(i.e their intersection is Null and union of two sets is sample space)

Then Pr(E1 U E2) means either E1 have non zero finite probability or E2 has non zero,finite probability or both have non zero finite probability.
So This ensures that atleast one event will occur.(Here Pr means probability of occurrence of an event)

So Yes we can Say Union is equivalent to Logical OR.

01/01/22, 6:36 pm - +91 82371 27097: Null hypothesis is rejected at a significance level if p-value is less than the significance level. 

If it is rejected at 0.06, then p-value is less than 0.06. Hence, if significance level is 0.07, p-value will still be less, and hence, null hypothesis will still be rejected.

01/01/22, 8:38 pm - +91 99998 58727: You did p(4).p(6) Cez they are independent event ?
01/01/22, 8:44 pm - +91 98859 97600: Nope maybe  ...even numbers greater than 3 in rolling a dice
01/01/22, 8:53 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yeah that is also a thing but those are independent too as we cannot get both at a time
01/01/22, 8:55 pm - +91 99998 58727: So getting 4 as a face first time is inpependent of getting 6 as face next time. I thought like that‚Ä¶ May be wrong too.
01/01/22, 8:58 pm - +91 70877 58526: I don't know how this ones correct cause first independent event rule is 
P(E intersection F) = P(E)P(F) and not P(E union F).
Second even if it is right how you did it. Probability should be multiplied and you are adding there, I don't understand that part.
01/01/22, 9:01 pm - +91 98859 97600: Maybe ...P(even  intersection >3) can be written as .... probability of all the numbers which are even and as well as greater than 3 ...
Here  we can have 2 options 4 or 6 ...so we did p(4) + p(6)
01/01/22, 9:02 pm - +91 77748 96465: Did anyone recieve link for jupyter money test?

01/01/22, 9:03 pm - +91 99998 58727: Right he has . And then adding is confusing
01/01/22, 9:03 pm - +91 70877 58526: Yes I can go with this explanation
01/01/22, 9:03 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually everything is fine, but just it just notations, replace P(4).P(6) with P(4) or P(6)
01/01/22, 9:06 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yes
01/01/22, 9:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: Exactly
01/01/22, 9:14 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Because they are mutually exclusive
01/01/22, 9:19 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: There is a small mistake. P(4U6)=P(4) + P(6)

02/01/22, 2:06 pm - +91 98933 88933: From the question it's clear that null hypothesis was rejected at 0.06 this means p-value is definitely less than 0.06 let's assume it's 0.0599

Even if we choose significance level of 0.07 p value will always be less than that (0.0599 < 0.07) hence null hypothesis will always be rejected at all significance levels > 0.06 if it was rejected at 0.06
02/01/22, 2:11 pm - +91 95603 55228: ok p value and significance both are independent and doesnt effect to each other. right?
02/01/22, 2:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes we can choose any significance level the p value computation is independent of that

02/01/22, 2:52 pm - +91 98933 88933: üëç
02/01/22, 2:52 pm - +91 70734 10928: Please also tell this

02/01/22, 2:53 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes we can
02/01/22, 2:53 pm - +91 98933 88933: but only use google calculator or jupyter notebook on that tab
02/01/22, 2:53 pm - +91 88003 13691: It's more clear , when X exceeds 3 Sigma limits , probability will be less than or equal to 11%
02/01/22, 2:54 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes, means we should use online Jupiter or can be access local one ?
02/01/22, 2:55 pm - +91 98933 88933: both can be ok, just the notebook should be clean, no code
02/01/22, 2:55 pm - +91 98933 88933: at start
02/01/22, 2:55 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes.
02/01/22, 2:55 pm - +91 70734 10928: Actually when I was giving the test, I was not able to minimise the screen of test. That's why asking
02/01/22, 2:56 pm - +91 98933 88933: You can open a new Chrome window anyways the entire screen is shared
02/01/22, 2:57 pm - +91 79806 28509: I have a doubt, suppose in the exam,  if the question is like find the result of this code, then typing the code in notebook & seeing the answer, doesn't make sense to the essence of the exam
02/01/22, 2:57 pm - +91 98933 88933: I didn't try that during the test though so not sure why it wasn't happening
02/01/22, 2:57 pm - +91 98933 88933: right that should not be done
02/01/22, 2:58 pm - +91 98933 88933: maybe they won't give code related problems in this exam, in the mock also there was only 1

02/01/22, 3:03 pm - +91 88003 13691: So, we should have taken e(-5)
02/01/22, 3:03 pm - +91 88003 13691: Yes

02/01/22, 3:03 pm - +91 98933 88933: I think the only leap here was to calculate the mean for 15 minutes, for 45 mins the mean is 5, for 15 mins it'll reduce in proportion
02/01/22, 3:04 pm - +91 88003 13691: But then we have to take for 2 and 3
02/01/22, 3:04 pm - +91 88003 13691: I got that...just confused in calculation part
02/01/22, 3:04 pm - +91 98933 88933: oh

02/01/22, 3:07 pm - +91 84948 36428: Thank You
02/01/22, 3:07 pm - +91 84948 36428: Thank you
02/01/22, 3:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: No, everyone got the same
02/01/22, 3:08 pm - +91 98933 88933: I think this one is from the practice 51 ques.
02/01/22, 3:08 pm - +91 98933 88933: not the mock
02/01/22, 3:08 pm - +91 98933 88933: the ques. wasn't very clear to me
02/01/22, 3:09 pm - +91 84948 36428: The image I sent is from Practice questions.. and yes we had same question in test
02/01/22, 3:09 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually I am also confused
02/01/22, 3:11 pm - +91 88003 13691: I guess they are tested one by one in a random order
02/01/22, 3:11 pm - +91 88003 13691: Toh identifying one faulty node is 1/15
02/01/22, 3:11 pm - +91 88003 13691: Then identifying another is 1/15
02/01/22, 3:12 pm - +91 99877 12457: Taking two at a time ?
02/01/22, 3:12 pm - +91 88003 13691: And they Botha re independent of each other
02/01/22, 3:12 pm - +91 88003 13691: No
02/01/22, 3:12 pm - +91 94529 09216: So it is saying to catch the fault in just two attempts that means
1. in first attempt I have 2 fault out of 6, so probability = 2/6
2. In second attempt I have only one fault remain, out of 5 , so probability = 1/5 
Now applying product rule , I am getting 1/15
02/01/22, 3:14 pm - +91 94529 09216: Are got it
02/01/22, 3:15 pm - +91 94529 09216: The solutions by sir is right
02/01/22, 3:15 pm - +91 94882 02727: If anyone has taken last minute notes, kindly share it
02/01/22, 3:15 pm - +91 94529 09216: U have to just apply permutation on top of it
02/01/22, 3:16 pm - +91 88003 13691: Haa but 2C2 is 1
02/01/22, 3:16 pm - +91 98910 16793: Use Permutation 6C2..
02/01/22, 3:17 pm - +91 98910 16793: 2 Chose out of 6
02/01/22, 3:17 pm - +91 79806 28509: 2C1/6C2
02/01/22, 3:17 pm - +91 94529 09216: No again got confused, I mean why I should apply permutations
02/01/22, 3:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: Can you please explain, I still didn't get it
02/01/22, 3:20 pm - +91 98910 16793: Probability= events/ sample space.
02/01/22, 3:20 pm - +91 88003 13691: <Media omitted>
02/01/22, 3:21 pm - +91 98910 16793: Here events =2 {(N2,N3),(N3,N2)}
02/01/22, 3:21 pm - +91 98933 88933: The ques. is "prob. that only 2 tests are reqd", the formulation will be

 = number of ways in which faulty nodes can be identified by only 2 tests/total number of ways of identifying faulty nodes

right now, the denominator only includes number of ways of doing 2 tests but how can we be sure that only 2 tests are reqd, I think the cases of 3,4,5..6 tests should be covered in the denominator
02/01/22, 3:22 pm - +91 98933 88933: for eg. one way of identifying the faulty nodes can be N4,N3,N2 this is not included in the denominator
02/01/22, 3:23 pm - +91 98933 88933: numerator formulation that i got
02/01/22, 3:23 pm - +91 98910 16793: Sample space= 6C2..Chose 2 Out of 6
02/01/22, 3:23 pm - +91 94529 09216: üëç got it sir, I mean , I was reading question wrong
02/01/22, 3:23 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes please share those..

02/01/22, 3:27 pm - +91 70734 10928: Bin width = max-min/no. Of bins then it will be 10 so..our bins will be like...1 to 10 then 11 to 20 and then 21 to 30 and then 31 to 40, then 41 to 50 so 4th bin is 31 to 40 and the points Falling in this range are only two
02/01/22, 3:27 pm - +91 78756 85040: +1
02/01/22, 3:27 pm - +91 79806 28509: Thanks, so it should be 2C2/6C2
02/01/22, 3:28 pm - +91 98933 88933: I'm not satisfied with the provided solution or maybe I'm not able to understand the ques clearly

02/01/22, 3:42 pm - +91 78756 85040: In order to have two tests only , one should sample two faulty nodes back to back consecutively
02/01/22, 3:43 pm - +91 94529 09216: Just try to imagine the difference between 
Probability of finding both the fault in first 2 attempts and
Probability of conducting just two test to find the fault
02/01/22, 3:43 pm - +91 78756 85040: Since it's random sampling there are two ways of sampling faulty nodes
02/01/22, 3:43 pm - +91 78756 85040: Exactly
02/01/22, 3:44 pm - +91 78756 85040: Well 2C2 != 2 right?
02/01/22, 3:44 pm - +91 78756 85040: How could it be 2C2/6C2
02/01/22, 3:45 pm - +91 88003 13691: It's 1
02/01/22, 3:46 pm - +91 78756 85040: Yes exactly
02/01/22, 3:46 pm - +91 79806 28509: 2C2 = 1, as per solution, it is 2c1/6C2..
02/01/22, 3:46 pm - +91 78756 85040: Okay thanks @917980628509

02/01/22, 3:48 pm - +91 78756 85040: But Why 2C1
02/01/22, 3:50 pm - +91 79806 28509: God save me, i dont know why, i'm just assuming that if we need to select 2 faulty nodes in 2 tests, then thare are 2 ways to select that
02/01/22, 3:51 pm - +65 8337 3637: The way I thought was:
The thinking might be wrong..
This solution gives me 1 way of finding it.
For e.g. nodeA first, nodeB 2nd
I will have another "way" of finding two faulty if nodeB is picked first and then nodeA
So I added 1/15 by itself.
02/01/22, 3:54 pm - +91 94529 09216: Look , I may have two different questions
Quest 1. Find the probability of finding faulty nodes in just two steps 
Ans = (2/6) * (1/5)
02/01/22, 3:55 pm - +91 94529 09216: But the question what sir is asking is different from this
02/01/22, 3:55 pm - +91 79806 28509: Enough of discussion on this one, i believe now we need some solid proof or can approach mentors

02/01/22, 4:15 pm - +91 78756 85040: Poisson distribution is intrinsically discrete in nature so it would be useful to probability of occurrences of events  (e.g  here goals in certain time interval)

02/01/22, 4:17 pm - +91 98859 97600: I think there is a typo ...coz P1 they gave as 5/7 and again P1 as 2/7 ....so it should be P1(complement) 
Here we are asked probability of favourable by majority...so out of 3 members majority means ... union of 2 members and 3 members

1. In log-normal distribution, the mean is not the same as the peak of the PDF
2. The common point in both Pareto and Log Normal Distributions is, "Both the distributions have a small number of larger values and a large number of smaller values." But the major difference is the Pareto Distribution does not have an increasing PDF

02/01/22, 8:44 pm - +91 99998 58727: Variance is lambda ^2 and asked s.d which is same as 20 not under root if it
02/01/22, 8:44 pm - +91 90388 76605: Nope
02/01/22, 8:44 pm - +91 99998 58727: Why?
02/01/22, 8:44 pm - +91 94882 02727: Since we are subtracting 1 on RHS '=' shouldn't come. I'm not sure
02/01/22, 8:44 pm - +91 94529 09216: Cdf should be between 0 to 1 na?
02/01/22, 8:45 pm - +91 97890 35993: Got 23
It seems like only watching khan academy course was helpful to attend this
02/01/22, 8:45 pm - +91 94882 02727: Yes in opt c its from 0 to 1
02/01/22, 8:45 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes, the y axis is between 0 and  1 only

02/01/22, 8:47 pm - +91 95370 26661: Yeah i feel yeh cdf wala is wrong. I think answer should be B
02/01/22, 8:47 pm - +91 77748 96465: Cdf has slope from 0 to 1
02/01/22, 8:47 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: It is  1.0 see the scale

02/01/22, 9:08 pm - +91 88510 78354: It gives max value 
-1 means starting from back and [0] means 1st value i.e max

02/01/22, 9:08 pm - +91 89210 23935: [::-1] reverse the list, so you get most important eigen
02/01/22, 9:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: This question is different from what they asked in exam.
02/01/22, 9:15 pm - +91 96666 32574: Do we have study groups in our batch...??

02/01/22, 9:24 pm - +91 88510 78354: 40 minsüòÇ Really???
02/01/22, 9:24 pm - +91 88510 78354: Howw is it A?

02/01/22, 9:25 pm - +91 94529 09216: Because we don't want our positive and negative distance to cancel out, we will use absolute distance
02/01/22, 9:26 pm - +91 91512 22368: I Got 19.
02/01/22, 9:27 pm - +91 72648 49874: Is this for profile building or serious work? Accordingly I can suggest projects

02/01/22, 9:30 pm - +91 95603 55228: what is kaggle? give me some idea...
02/01/22, 9:34 pm - +91 95603 55228: i think, we focused on logic and concept rather than marks..i did not see in my several experience that any one ask about marks during interview. so who got good marks its great...but who got less marks, believe it doesnt matter at the end..only target passing marks...focus on concept...
02/01/22, 9:36 pm - +91 96184 80572: Very true

02/01/22, 9:38 pm - +91 78935 18350: It's a platform for aspiring data scientists..it has tonnes of data sets for performing EDA and building ML models. It also hosts various Data science competitions to compete with the world.
02/01/22, 9:39 pm - +91 95603 55228: right, before my first job, i felt same things..got less marks then felt hopeless. but its not...not loose hope and sad..try to understand concept, and crack interview in good company......just trying to motivate...
02/01/22, 9:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: Totally agree sir üôå
02/01/22, 9:41 pm - +91 79806 28509: Do we get anyone to mentir in project there? 
And competitions are participated in grp ir single?
02/01/22, 9:42 pm - +91 90357 92877: Are marks awarded for attending live sessions?
I read that it has a weightage of 10 marks....where is this info given?
02/01/22, 9:43 pm - +91 78935 18350: Mentors will not be there specifically...you can start communicating with people on discussion forums and you can start doing projects as a group.
02/01/22, 9:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: 10 marks for attendance, quiz, mandatory assignment all together.. it was said in one of the live sessions
02/01/22, 9:43 pm - +91 72648 49874: No mentor. Songle or group projects allowed.
02/01/22, 9:43 pm - +91 72648 49874: Single*
02/01/22, 9:44 pm - +91 99998 58727: Agree. Focus on understanding ‚úåüèª
02/01/22, 9:48 pm - +91 95370 26661: This says least.. C option gives you the max.
02/01/22, 9:57 pm - +91 95603 55228: ok great..platform..thanks
02/01/22, 10:07 pm - +91 91512 22368: I also got just 19.Paper was easy so we need to improve ourself that's goes without saying. But understanding of concepts is more important but marks are also reflection of it. Mid sem marks are good place to assess our understanding and standing but nothing is lost luckily for us the course remain same we just need to be more thorough I am pretty sure result will follow.

There are many projects that you can think of and do. One of the initial projects I did when I was learning initially was to create a regression model to estimate the price of flats in Pune city. When I started working in this domain, I used the same methodology and created a model for our HR Team to decide the salary of an employee joining the company given the properties like education, certification, yrs of exp, etc. Similar to this, you'll be able to find and start working on lots of projects.

03/01/22, 7:39 am - +91 89783 80243: V2 V4 V5 60% we can get..but option is not there..
03/01/22, 7:40 am - +91 91762 75222: No no... We have to get from values from reverse sorted
03/01/22, 7:42 am - +91 89210 23935: I agree
03/01/22, 7:44 am - +91 90357 92877: Yes this combination gives 60%, but the option is missing....hence we check for one of the options where the values add up to >= 60%,thats why V1 V2 and V4
03/01/22, 7:54 am - +91 96505 18893: Yeah but if u consider real life scenario it will be like minimum 60% of the information.

03/01/22, 9:08 am - +91 89715 68712: In applied roots diploma, we will not be having assignments, like the way we had in applied ai course i guess.
03/01/22, 9:09 am - +91 79806 28509: I recall sir told, we will have real world capstone project in 2nd sem
03/01/22, 9:10 am - +91 89715 68712: Ya. But actually that's just one right?  In applied ai course it was like, the logistic, linear regression models we have to build without sklearn üòÖ
03/01/22, 9:11 am - +91 89715 68712: Those were the type of assignments
03/01/22, 9:11 am - +91 78935 18350: We will be having around 10-15 selected assignments out of 30 assignments from applied ai course but as an optional. They have added for Batch -1 students, so they might be adding for us too. This might happen in second semester first course I guess.
03/01/22, 9:12 am - +91 89715 68712: Oh that's cool.
03/01/22, 9:17 am - +91 78935 18350: By the end of sem-1 we will be able to do the ML projects end to end and for Deep learning projects we have course - 3 in sem -2

03/01/22, 9:19 am - +91 88988 90243: None of these

03/01/22, 9:27 am - +91 88845 57276: Not all the 30 assignments?
03/01/22, 9:31 am - +91 78935 18350: I heard sir saying that all 30 assignments will take so much of time to complete along with course completion, mandatory assignments and also with our daily job. So, they have hand picked nearly 15 assignments which covers all the topics and they are super rigourous. If we have any time left, they will give few more I guess.
03/01/22, 9:33 am - +91 78935 18350: I got this information from one of the live sessions available in course - 2. This is what they followed for batch-1, don't know if any change for us

03/01/22, 9:36 am - +91 99998 58727: As far as I remember and when I confirmed with Sir at starting of this diploma 
We will be having all case studies but as optional. And one final project that will have mentor n all

03/01/22, 12:42 pm - +91 87587 85027: My 2 cents - TBH as @918800313691  & @919999858727 said and I think completing the course content and assignment should be a priority. I know from the videoes of success story that case study and projects were driving force but the contents are fundamentals and assignment as application (small task of larger project). We should definitely do projects on our own if we feel confident that we are all set but I think from my personal exp, we can start working on project after course 3 classical machine learning completes or toward its end. I know how excited we all are to solve real life problems and learn from them and I think we all will be helpful if we do this with strong fundamentals.

03/01/22, 4:59 pm - +91 79806 28509: Thanks, this we can include in our portfolio
03/01/22, 5:00 pm - +91 79806 28509: But its not project, its just a ML concept coding
03/01/22, 5:01 pm - +91 90357 92877: More of a coding assignment this is...but a very good assignment nonetheless
Its one of the assignments of the Applied AI course
03/01/22, 5:03 pm - +91 79806 28509: Do we have any mcq practice questions in this ML course?
03/01/22, 5:03 pm - +91 88988 90243: Is it allowed to put course assignments to our GitHub profile?
03/01/22, 5:04 pm - +91 94529 09216: I don't know , but I did when I was doing applied ai
03/01/22, 5:04 pm - +91 94529 09216: And most people did
03/01/22, 5:05 pm - +91 90357 92877: You can keep it private
03/01/22, 5:06 pm - +91 88988 90243: We can showcase these to recruiters then giving question credit to applied ai
03/01/22, 5:09 pm - +91 94529 09216: So basically in every assignment half part is done by appliedroots team, in which they give credit to the person/team , whom code they used, and rest half part was done by us . 
So , I don't think there should be any problem for uploading it to GitHub, just give the credit and everything will be fine
03/01/22, 5:10 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yes üëç
03/01/22, 5:10 pm - +91 90357 92877: Actually posting the assignments publicly is discouraged by applied ai
They might tell this to us later
03/01/22, 5:10 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually not every, but in most assignment
03/01/22, 5:11 pm - +91 94529 09216: Accha, I didn't knew that
03/01/22, 5:11 pm - +91 90357 92877: What you can do is you can implement many of these topics and put it up as a blog or something

04/01/22, 12:22 am - +91 78935 55163: Hi all, went through the first video of course 3, I see lot of libraries used in the code, as I know in course 1 we learnt about numpy and pandas. What about others, we need learn by our own and how we will know when to use what. Plz advice on this.

04/01/22, 6:16 am - +91 89399 22582: Libraries might change by time with additional features or new libraries might come up with different set of features, but underlying concepts will remain same. 

So, we should be more focused on conceptual stuff and libraries will follow the way

04/01/22, 6:57 am - +91 78935 18350: Agree, there are tonnes of libraries out there, so focusing and remembering them is not a good advice. with a considerable amount of hands-on we would be able to remember good number of libraries/syntaxes etc. which are enough to crack any interview

04/01/22, 1:36 pm - +91 79806 28509: Seema like you're trying to import/use local file which is possible in jupyter, but not in colab, for colab, there are different ways to upload files from local
or as an optimum approach, you can use !wget command or import file from google drive
04/01/22, 1:37 pm - +91 79806 28509: Anyone feels i described this not correctly can asssist, as i'm beginner as well

04/01/22, 1:41 pm - +91 99721 79093: Yeah you need to add a chrome extension and use the link to make it work
04/01/22, 1:41 pm - +91 99721 79093: This takes a lot of time
04/01/22, 1:42 pm - +91 99721 79093: Use this method, it will just take few seconds to upload and use dataset
04/01/22, 1:49 pm - +91 79806 28509: for importing local file in colab, use this-
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

04/01/22, 7:24 pm - +91 98933 88933: B option is also the same as C, you can read it as the prob. distance between x and mu being less than k*sigma is at least 1-1/k2 , 

Distance between x and mu being less than k*sigma is another way of saying X lies between mu-k*sigma and mu+k*sigma
04/01/22, 7:43 pm - +91 78756 85040: Did option c is just the expansion of option b? Who remembers properties of Modulus!

I have noticed this. Put your phone nearby (works like a charm if it is an iphone). Talk about Azure. FB will pounce you with Azure ads.
This has happened with me

05/01/22, 5:14 am - +1 (514) 974-0682: The way its setup now there is no privacy since the blockchains are immutable and corporations don't want that since anyone can gauge all of their transactions. Plus these banks and mega corporations are building out their in-house solutions or rival products to these crypto.

06/01/22, 12:43 pm - +91 77748 96465: System design*
06/01/22, 1:31 pm - +91 72648 49874: Question (for fun) (for all who have studied KNN Classifier): why did Srikanth said that the time complexity at run time (during prediction) is O(n.d) if KNN is a machine learning algorithm which learns the patterns from the data (using distance metrics) ? 

Hint: Which type of learner is KNN Classifier? üòâ
06/01/22, 1:32 pm - +91 83329 81498: it's a lazy learning algorithm
06/01/22, 1:33 pm - +91 94529 09216: I don't know of types, but for sure it doesn't uses optimization
06/01/22, 1:33 pm - +91 83329 81498: it doesnt 'learn' anything
06/01/22, 1:33 pm - +91 94529 09216: Like other algorithms do
06/01/22, 1:33 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yes üëç
06/01/22, 1:34 pm - +91 94529 09216: To be honest , every time I learn about KNN, a question arises in my mind, why it is called machine learning algorithm
06/01/22, 2:14 pm - +91 88640 27876: this is itself a phd degree man
06/01/22, 2:35 pm - +91 72648 49874: I agree üòÄ
06/01/22, 2:36 pm - +91 72648 49874: exactly! only when the unknown point comes to picture, then only all the calculations takes place. Hence during training time there are no computations done at all, but the data is held into the memory (depending on how we have loaded it)
06/01/22, 2:39 pm - +91 91762 75222: I don't think so... Srikanth sir did masters in iisc, this not even equal to 10% of his masters

07/01/22, 5:12 pm - +91 97912 22474: What should be the path here
07/01/22, 5:14 pm - +91 96505 18893: U are doing it in jupyter notebook or colab?
07/01/22, 5:16 pm - +91 89715 68712: The table name is sqlite_master? Why, after as you have put apostrophe?
07/01/22, 5:16 pm - +91 73825 54571: implemnting assignmnt in tf-idf from scratch means shouldn't we use built-in funtions
07/01/22, 5:17 pm - +91 96505 18893: I think this is optional SQL assignment nah ??
07/01/22, 5:18 pm - +91 94909 24078: We can use numpy
07/01/22, 5:19 pm - +91 97912 22474: In colab
07/01/22, 5:21 pm - +91 97912 22474: I haven't changed anything. I have opened the colab  directly from the Google drive
07/01/22, 5:21 pm - +91 89715 68712: It's more like you must understand the logic, use pandas, numpy and for loops only and build a function
07/01/22, 5:21 pm - +91 97912 22474: I am not sure if it's optional or mandatory
07/01/22, 5:21 pm - +91 96505 18893: Then u will have to upload the imdb file using upload functionality
07/01/22, 5:21 pm - +91 97912 22474: Oh okay
07/01/22, 5:22 pm - +91 73825 54571: okay
07/01/22, 5:22 pm - +91 89715 68712: Or you can just put it in your drive and map the path
07/01/22, 5:22 pm - +91 73825 54571: teek heinn
07/01/22, 5:22 pm - +91 89715 68712: But i don't think that's the error, because conn variable is not showing error.
07/01/22, 5:23 pm - +91 89715 68712: Can you show properly like what exact error your getting?
07/01/22, 5:23 pm - +91 94529 09216: Those who directly used code provided by applied roots team, I suggest you guys read the concept of present working directory / current working directory.

07/01/22, 5:28 pm - +91 97912 22474: I will once check it
07/01/22, 5:47 pm - +91 97912 22474: I connected with the team and the issue is resolved

07/01/22, 7:32 pm - +91 94529 09216: Data School is best of all
07/01/22, 7:33 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yes , but now enjoying this course, it's like revision for me, and I have become more responsible
07/01/22, 7:33 pm - +91 98315 06503: Varma sir's content is too overwhelming. i dont look anywhere else
07/01/22, 7:35 pm - +91 94529 09216: Data school, Stats quest and Krish Naik are my favourite one
07/01/22, 7:36 pm - +91 94529 09216: But for code , you have to look elsewhere
07/01/22, 7:36 pm - +91 94529 09216: Or you will have to scratch your head for hours
07/01/22, 7:38 pm - +91 94529 09216: You will find a small gap , between what sir explain and  when you have to complete assessment
07/01/22, 7:39 pm - +91 94529 09216: I mean he will explain all the concepts of machine learning in a great way but still a lot of people face a little bit of problem while doing the assignment
07/01/22, 7:40 pm - +91 97396 15111: Have we covered Nltk in the course ?
07/01/22, 7:40 pm - +91 97396 15111: I don‚Äôt recall going through nltk in the previous sessions
07/01/22, 7:40 pm - +91 94529 09216: It's big library
07/01/22, 7:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: We have to explore it by our own
07/01/22, 7:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: But our assignment are all related to NLP only
07/01/22, 7:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: I mean of the total assignment
07/01/22, 7:42 pm - +91 97396 15111: There are quite a few stuff that we are bound to know by default ?? I mean it‚Äôs ok for computer science based ppl but what about others üôÑ

07/01/22, 7:47 pm - +91 83418 08163: Hello All,

as many people were interested in forming study group...why don't we form a group of 5 people where in:
1) experienced person from DataScience Domain(1 person)

2) Experienced IT Professionals (1 person)

3)Students/1-2 Year IT people(2-3 Members)

If possible people can give out their interests and then we can map them accordingly ..

 Also there should be availability as one more column where one can mention daily, weekends and also convenient time
07/01/22, 10:29 pm - +91 83418 08163: Sure will add that one ...
07/01/22, 10:29 pm - +91 83418 08163: I think sheets can get clumsy so forms would be better for collecting responses from people
07/01/22, 10:31 pm - +91 83418 08163: I think once the smallest group is formed they can decide the timings based on the smaller groups convenience
07/01/22, 10:32 pm - +91 89210 23935: One other option is. We have airmeet lounge/table right? If someone can host a airmeet session with that option. After discussion, participants can select what is best for them.
07/01/22, 10:32 pm - +91 89210 23935: I just mentioned it to avoid reallocation after forming groups. ‚úåÔ∏èwhatever the group prefers..
07/01/22, 10:34 pm - +91 83418 08163: Yaa we can try that out too...I am not aware of this option.
07/01/22, 10:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: It was tried out during live coaching session on statistics by Sreekanth sir.
07/01/22, 10:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: Participants can join or leave a table and go to a table which is convenient for them
07/01/22, 10:37 pm - +91 83418 08163: If all the people discuss and then if we need to come to some consensus that would take a lot of time
07/01/22, 10:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes. Group call will be a good option to speed that up.

08/01/22, 8:13 pm - +91 89210 23935: Generally to download a file to google colab we only need to do 

!wget download_url

To download from Google drive, this cannot be used.

So we install curlwget extension.
1. Download the file.
2. Cancel the download
3. Click on curlwget extension there will be a code generated.
4. Copy paste the code to colab. Add '!' in front of the code.
5. If you leave calab and come back later, you cannot use the same wget code. You need to repeat steps 1 to 4
08/01/22, 8:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: Step 1 to 4 works for downloading almost all files.

09/01/22, 6:58 pm - +91 89210 23935: Keys are helpful to easily retrieve a set of data points which belong to one side of the hyperplane. We can do knn on these set of points but we might not get the best result if the point is too close to the  hyperplane in case of cosine distance. So to increase the chance of having more neighbours, we take multiple random hyperplane and take union of all these results to perform knn. The keys, I think are the weights of hyperplane which is fixed once it is assigned for a given model. So I believe we only need to perform knn on these union and keys will not change. If I understand it correctly.
09/01/22, 7:00 pm - +91 94529 09216: But sir when we will create L hashtable we will get L keys also na, I am just curious to know like we perform union operation on values, do we perform any kind of operation on keys too?
09/01/22, 7:00 pm - +91 94529 09216: Btw, great explaination üëè
09/01/22, 7:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: My knowledge of LSH is only theoretical, that too from applied ai course. With my limited knowledge, I don't see any reason to change keys of dictionary as it represents coefficients of hyperplane. If you post this question as a comment in the video section, they will give you an answer which you can be confident.
09/01/22, 7:08 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually I posted, but thanks for healthy conversations üòÄ

09/01/22, 8:25 pm - +91 98910 16793: Its not opening for me
09/01/22, 8:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: @919452909216  There is a correction in what I said. So I am doing feynman here.
Hashing keys doesn't represents coefficient of hyperplane, but *the direction with respect to m hyperplanes.* 

So the entire thing is as follows.
We generate m hyperplanes from N(0,1). So the *coefficient of each hyperplanes are random values from N(0,1).* 

Let's look at x1.
We take m such hyperplanes belonging to N(0,1) and calculate w1'x1 w2'x1, ... wm'x1. 
Depending on the value it generate we assign +1 if wi.T*x1>=0, else -1. 
This gives us information about where it lies in the hyperspace with respect to these hyperplane.
Eg:
w1'x1 >=0 means[+1,_, _,...,_]
w2'x1 <0 means [+1,-1,_,...,_]
wm'x1 <0 means [+1,-1,....,-1]
These will be the keys of your dictionary.

When we say x1 has a key [+1,-1], It means, x1 lies in the positive half space of w1 (w1'x1 >=0) and negative half space of w2 (w1'x1 <0).
So, as of now L1[(+1,-1)] has value {x1}, if another point x5 has same [+1,-1], then L1[(+1,-1)] will be {x1,x5}

This is only for hash table 1, say L1.
We have L such hash tables.
For L2, x1 can belong to [-1,-1] also, it totally depends on the hyperplanes which come from N(0,1).

To perform knn,
We take union of all the values based on where the *query point lies in L1 and L2*.
If query point lies in [+1,-1] of L1 and [-1,-1] of L2. We perform knn on *set(L1[+1,-1] UNION L2[-1,-1])*

So to answer your question, while querying there is no need to change keys because we are only interested in obtaining union of data points from different dictonaries where the query point lies. However the keys can be different for different hash tables L1,L2 etc.. because they have different set of hyperplanes
09/01/22, 8:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: If anyone took mock interview from applied ai course, can you tell me how is the question asked?
09/01/22, 9:21 pm - +91 94529 09216: Completely got it sir üëç
09/01/22, 9:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: That means we need to perform L hash functions on our query data point too , which will give us  L keys (each of dimension m), and to get the K nearest neighbour we will perform Union operation on all the L values which we get
09/01/22, 9:31 pm - +91 94529 09216: Please correct if i am still missing something
09/01/22, 9:35 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes, this is what I understood from the course.
09/01/22, 9:35 pm - +91 94529 09216: üëç
09/01/22, 9:39 pm - +91 83329 81498: I did not take them but a friend did. Initially questions were asked from linear algebra and stats (from intuition behind dot product to various distributions). Based on his answers next questions were asked. In his case, he was asked about course case studies.
09/01/22, 10:08 pm - +91 98933 88933: First or second?
09/01/22, 10:08 pm - +91 89210 23935: First.
09/01/22, 10:08 pm - +91 89210 23935: Thank you.
09/01/22, 10:10 pm - +91 98933 88933: Simple ques. about basics mostly theoritical ques. from course content like what is overfitting cross validation about some metrics maybe some ML technique
09/01/22, 10:10 pm - +91 98933 88933: i wasn't asked deep learning or case studies in 1 mock
09/01/22, 10:10 pm - +91 98933 88933: it is easy if you've covered the videos in the course content
09/01/22, 10:10 pm - +91 89210 23935: Will there be code implementations?
09/01/22, 10:11 pm - +91 98933 88933: I wasn't asked
09/01/22, 10:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: Any derivations?
09/01/22, 10:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: nopes
09/01/22, 10:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: moslty conceptual ques.
09/01/22, 10:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: with some twists, turns and corner cases
09/01/22, 10:13 pm - +91 98933 88933: like an interview setup basically
09/01/22, 10:13 pm - +91 89210 23935: Ohh okay. Mentors will be assigned after the interview right?
09/01/22, 10:13 pm - +91 98933 88933: I was assigned when I started my case study
09/01/22, 10:13 pm - +91 98933 88933: not after interview
09/01/22, 10:14 pm - +91 89210 23935: How is the mentorship provided for case studies? Do we have appointments where we have to tell our progress or something like that?
09/01/22, 10:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: Or we can ask guidance anytime through phone?
09/01/22, 10:22 pm - +91 98933 88933: We can post comments on the applied roots classroom regarding architectural queries or major steps, mostly metors reply there only if reqd they call us on phones or schedule a meeting on Google meet

Regular sync up meetings are scheduled on Gmeet after one significant portion of case study is completed like 1 after eda 1 after feat. Engg etc.
09/01/22, 10:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: That's perfect! Thank you @919893388933 and @918332981498

09/01/22, 10:31 pm - +91 97017 42260: Guys...How do we upload the assignment in the classroom after we complete it in google colab ??
09/01/22, 10:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: Download the file from colab

In classroom, go to
Add submission > upload documents as ipynb> submit.

Try to upload pdf as well since they mentioned it.
If you have error and don't want to go through the hurdle of installing 3rd party tools, you can simply print as pdf with A4 or A3 size.
09/01/22, 10:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: Error when saving as pdf through jupyter notebook. You can open the ipynb files in jupyter notebook and print as pdf.
09/01/22, 10:39 pm - +91 98933 88933: Or directly print the colab notebook by ctrl+p
09/01/22, 10:40 pm - +91 98933 88933: Then save as pdf
09/01/22, 10:40 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes.
09/01/22, 10:42 pm - +91 89210 23935: Once you set up the error in jupyter notebook, it is very clean pdf output unlike print as pdf.

12/01/22, 12:39 am - +91 88988 90243: Thanks Indranil for your helpüôè
12/01/22, 1:27 am - +91 81445 54148: All db engines like Oracle work on cost based optimizer. Based on the cost the optimizer will select the best plan. If we have index on the where clause then it will go for index scan bringing down the cost.
12/01/22, 1:28 am - +91 81445 54148: In Spark for disb. Systems we have a concept of lazy evaluation where the predicate pruning happens that is filter is applied first
12/01/22, 1:35 am - +91 88988 90243: Yeah
12/01/22, 8:05 am - +91 72648 49874: Your understanding is correct. Thia is usually how we deaign queries on large data warehouses. E.g., I needed customer churn data for our customers in Turkey for last 4yrs. So my first where clause will be on transaction date, followed by country, at minimum. 

@918898890243 hope this helps. 

Now how this query will be optimally executed in the database will depend on the datavase software since every database have their own way.

13/01/22, 10:09 pm - +91 89210 23935: Hi, I want to improve my SQL proficiency that fits an *entry level data analyst role*

In our course quizzes and problems, I found solving theoretical problems very hard.
I was not able to complete the mandatory quizzes because of lack of knowledge in theory of databases/sql. 
My question is: *What is the depth of theory in SQL/ Databases that I need to learn for a data analyst/data scientist?*
*What is the best place to learn these theory for a non-cs person?*

Regarding practice,
I only know how to retrieve data from a sql databases which was taught in the course. 
*Can you please suggest where to find SQL projects that I can do to showcase my skill on github?*

My goal/hope is, by end of going through these materials, I should be comfortable with ANY, EXISTS, ALL, Confusing Problems, and I should be able to solve *our SQL assignments* comfortably.
13/01/22, 10:10 pm - +91 89210 23935: *comfortably/uncomfortably
13/01/22, 10:12 pm - +91 89715 68712: Focus on the window functions too, they are very important, Rank, Dense Rank, Coalesce, row number etc. 

And best advice what i can give is, Use hacker Rank, it's the best. 

Learn about SQL from w3 resources and practice the questions on hacker rank. If you reach to 3-4 Star. Then your all ready for the interview.
13/01/22, 10:13 pm - +91 82371 27097: Thanks for framing this. Have the same questions, have the same goals.

13/01/22, 10:15 pm - +91 89715 68712: These two cover almost all, but in SQL, you must know when to use what. For that, you must practice on hacker rank and solve problems.
13/01/22, 10:16 pm - +91 89715 68712: Welcome
13/01/22, 10:18 pm - +91 90082 30682: Thank you
13/01/22, 10:21 pm - +91 89210 23935: Thank you very much @918971568712 . How long will it take for a beginner to reach 3-4 stars in hackerank?
13/01/22, 10:22 pm - +91 89210 23935: If the beginner outs 1 to 2 hours a day
13/01/22, 10:22 pm - +91 89715 68712: It's more about consistency bro, if you practice every day 2hrs. Close to 60-90 days is more than enough, to be very good at it. But remember, SQL is never about theory, understand when to use what.

14/01/22, 9:34 am - +91 99451 11649: You can do modular programming with both ides, which cant be in jupyter notebook. If some one looking for product devlopement then these are useful
14/01/22, 9:43 am - +91 88988 90243: Please explain more
14/01/22, 9:44 am - +91 88988 90243: Any example
14/01/22, 10:40 am - +91 97018 27354: My 2 cents, spend some time learning the keyboard shortcuts for Jupyter, for eda/prototyping you'll never need to leave/switch tab again, saves time, you can access all the documentation you'll need in Jupyter instantly. Use vim/emacs/vscode for production; APIs, libraries, tests...
14/01/22, 10:46 am - +91 97018 27354: Q: The separate classroom site has all the assignments right? And few in between videos. Anything else I might be missing?
14/01/22, 3:43 pm - +91 98912 03778: Hello everyone.. do we have a live session this weekend.. I don't receive any email notifications.. So if u get any then pls copy paste it here.. Thanks..
14/01/22, 6:16 pm - +91 72648 49874: You can consider these environments as the ones used by software development teams to create actual production like softwares. 

Examples will be a website to predict your GRE score or a banking application to perform credit card defaulter identification, and so on. 

Jupyter notebooks are great. But they are majorly for exploration of a solution and not for its productionization always.
14/01/22, 9:56 pm - +91 88988 90243: Any session tomorrow?

16/01/22, 7:43 am - +91 89210 23935: Hi, If anyone worked with time series forecasting, can you provide resources that you found helpful?
16/01/22, 12:29 pm - +91 88855 50259: There is a course in Kaggle about handling time series data which you can try. And for visualizing time series data, there are good tools in plotly library.
16/01/22, 12:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: The kaggle one is good. I found a course by 365 data science, I found it useful as well. Thank you..
16/01/22, 12:45 pm - +91 72648 49874: Forecasting principles book is available for free on their website whivh is a very good resource.

18/01/22, 4:46 am - +91 89210 23935: Most heavily advertised edtech firms focuses on making profits than caring for students. I have talked with some students who enrolled to these courses and they regret making that decision. I think UGC is trying to discourage those partnerships which uses the university branding and doesn't deliver quality education after students pouring money into these courses.
18/01/22, 6:59 am - +91 72648 49874: This is very true but there are few genuine cases as well like AppliedAiCourse!
18/01/22, 7:54 am - +91 89210 23935: Applied Roots courses are very affordable for the quality they provide, and it is the best investment in my life.

18/01/22, 7:58 am - +91 89210 23935: When I enquired about the applied ai course last year, their attitude was like: only join the course if you are willing to put a lot of effort. They didn't pushed me to join 78k diploma program compared to 30 k applied ai course when I enquired about it. To be honest, I wished they had pushed me to join diploma program that time.
18/01/22, 8:02 am - +91 89210 23935: They were polite and being realistic and true at the same time
18/01/22, 8:04 am - +91 95004 40196: we all wish this course to be continued and supported by ugc
18/01/22, 8:09 am - +91 77748 96465: AAIC is more student oriented rather than profit oriented...I dnt want to comment much Abt other edtechs. ..but looking at their course prices ....they seem to focus more on money than students...
AAIC and UoH is one of the best Collab in this field....they will continue this genuine course and will start MS very soon I feel

22/01/22, 4:59 pm - +91 70877 58526: Guys how can we manage for 5 case studies in a week
22/01/22, 5:00 pm - +91 77748 96465: Case studies are not part of syllabus.. but they are very important...u can do whn u get time evn after exam
22/01/22, 5:23 pm - +91 70877 58526: I think that after every exam. The next part takes alot of time for itself üòÖ
22/01/22, 7:39 pm - +91 99998 58727: Can anyone tell me in tf-idf assignment 

The grader cell has has 6 columns whereas if I do unique of all words in the corpus that will make 11 columns for the tf-idf matrix
22/01/22, 7:41 pm - +91 89783 80243: We have to calculate tfidf score for each sentence..no need to calculate for all unique words.

4 sentences each has 6 words..output should be 4X6 matrix
22/01/22, 7:43 pm - +91 99998 58727: You mean we have to ignore wherever tf-idf will be zero
22/01/22, 7:43 pm - +91 99998 58727: ?
22/01/22, 7:43 pm - +91 99998 58727: Cez wherever the unique word will be missing tf-idf product would be zero
22/01/22, 7:44 pm - +91 89783 80243: No..

Take first sentence ,it has 6 words.for each individual word calculate tfidf score and assign it whether it is zero or non zero.

Similar to remaining 3 sentences
22/01/22, 7:45 pm - +91 89783 80243: Correct..to avoid this, they have given in the below manner.
22/01/22, 7:46 pm - +91 99998 58727: But ideally by logic tf-idf should generate sparse matrix for all words
22/01/22, 7:46 pm - +91 99998 58727: Got it ‚úåüèª

22/01/22, 9:48 pm - +91 81445 54148: Can somebody help with this understanding
22/01/22, 9:59 pm - +91 73825 54571: Yes
22/01/22, 9:59 pm - +91 73825 54571: Whats ur doubt
22/01/22, 10:02 pm - +91 89210 23935: During cv or test time, when you give xq to knn, it calculates distance from xq to all other points in the *training data.* Once it is done, we get neighbours k neighbours (eg: x15, x36, x44, x3, x7). We classify yq as the most frequent class labels among these neighbours. If the neighbours classes are (1,0,1,0,0) we classify it as class 0
22/01/22, 10:02 pm - +91 98933 88933: While finding CV accuracy:
Take a point in Dcv, find its distance with all points of Dtrain, choose the minimum k distances and decide the label accordingly
repeat this for all points in Dcv

While finding train accuracy:
Take a point in Dtrain make it query point find its distance from remaining points in Dtrain choose minimum k distances and decide class label accordingly
repeat this for all points in Dtrain
22/01/22, 10:04 pm - +91 98933 88933: The points from which distance is calculated (or the "neighbours" in KNN) always come from Dtrain
22/01/22, 10:05 pm - +91 98933 88933: (or Dtrain+Dcv if using k-fold cross validation)
22/01/22, 10:12 pm - +91 73825 54571: To find accuracy on Dcv we take Dcv point but training is done only with Dtrain.,so xi is a data point in Dcv xq is query point and yq is classified point i.e, yi based on machine learning model..here, (xi,yi) belong to same dataset.
Now, we take K data points(xi) from dataset so as to apply funtion on those K number of datapoints to conclude the classification of yi point..

With the results we can know the accuracy

22/01/22, 10:16 pm - +91 73825 54571: Did it solve ur doubt
22/01/22, 10:18 pm - +91 81445 54148: Yes it did. my doubt was with accuracy on dcv , for finding the label  yq should we use dcv or dtrain. 

For accuracy of dcv we will use the train data from dtrain to find the yq. 

Whereas for dtrain accuracy I will use the dtrain dataset itself.

23/01/22, 10:47 am - +91 72648 49874: Hi @918144554148 : consider d-train as your textbook from where you will learn the concepts, d-cv is the guidelines which improves your timing or handwriting during the exam, and d-test contains the set of mock tests which will make you ready for the final exam. so, from d-train you learn, from d-cv you validate/improve, and from d-test you score/rate yourself. The same should happen with any ML model. all of d-test, d-train and d-cv should be good representative samples of the population; usually this split is 60-20-20 if you have good amount of data. Does that help?

This is to inform that Optional ML Assignments have now been added to your respective classrooms so whoever is interested in taking up those, please feel free to go ahead. We would also like to officially announce that the last day to submit all the Mandatory First Semester Assignments is by the end of the semester which is on 27th March, 2022.

Please pass on this announcement to any other groups that you may also have as some people are having trouble receiving our emails. Help us ensure that this reaches everyone. Thanks in advance!

27/01/22, 9:26 pm - +91 92058 52308: If the data is static you can use any complex model (xgboost) to predict and then tunn accordingly.

If data change you need to try time series techniques
27/01/22, 9:27 pm - +91 88510 78354: <Media omitted>
27/01/22, 9:28 pm - +91 88510 78354: last month sales data
27/01/22, 9:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: Does item goes out of stock?
27/01/22, 9:32 pm - +91 88510 78354: no
27/01/22, 9:32 pm - +91 89210 23935: There is similar problem M5 accuracy and M5 uncertainty on kaggle. But they had years of data and 5/7 winning solution used lightGBM. In this case since we have like 4 week data, maybe SARIMA like models?
27/01/22, 9:32 pm - +91 89210 23935: On week basis
27/01/22, 9:32 pm - +91 95582 32982: Take simple time series model or take simple avg no need ML
27/01/22, 9:33 pm - +91 88510 78354: can you elaborate please?
27/01/22, 9:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: But if you predict 5 breads instead of 9 breads, they 4 customers gets product next day or so
27/01/22, 9:34 pm - +91 89210 23935: If we take simple avg
27/01/22, 9:36 pm - +91 95582 32982: That's true but when you don't have sufficient data then you can make Decision based on simple methods
27/01/22, 9:37 pm - +91 95582 32982: This message was deleted
27/01/22, 9:38 pm - +91 95582 32982: Or you can make your custom data based on situation(data get from some API's)
Find pattern from them and Test on your actual data

27/01/22, 9:42 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think analyst with domain experience beats any ml models here
27/01/22, 9:44 pm - +91 95582 32982: That's ultimate truth
28/01/22, 5:49 am - +91 74149 09496: Hello Guys I have not started subject 3 because my health issues, how can I complete this course and assignment please give me any tips pleaseüôè
28/01/22, 6:25 am - +91 73825 54571: Start it.
Dont get panic
Its never too late
Something is better than nothing
28/01/22, 6:31 am - +91 79806 28509: Meanwhile you are planning to study , i'm still stuck in night shift prod support issues
28/01/22, 6:45 am - +61 435 080 700: Very true .even it takes next 10 years for u to complete..it is worth it .
28/01/22, 6:45 am - +61 435 080 700: I wasn't able to progress in subject 3 due to my personal reasons..so u are not alone
28/01/22, 6:46 am - +61 435 080 700: Everyone has their own challenges
28/01/22, 7:12 am - +91 90324 45343: True..
28/01/22, 7:23 am - +91 94529 09216: I will be very much realistic with you, first 3 chapters will take atleast a two week
28/01/22, 7:23 am - +91 94529 09216: And I suggest to give 2 week to first 3 chapters
28/01/22, 7:24 am - +91 94529 09216: And then rest you can easily cover 2 chapters a week
28/01/22, 7:41 am - +91 74149 09496: thanks guys for your suggestion I will follow your advice. thanks a lotüôè
28/01/22, 10:33 am - +91 89210 23935: Realistically, you only have enough time. No time to waste. You should consider time to learn these concept + assignments.

Each chapter is important in its own way. The first few modules gives kind of all picture with knn. Leaning this well helps in learning other models better.
Then you learn performance metrics, this could be confusing and need to start early so you have enough time to revise.

Just note few things.
Svm is hard, so when you learn logistic regression and optimization, put more attention. These concepts are used in deep learning in next sem (LR and optimization), so understanding this well could help your next semester also.

When you learn Decision trees, try to understand it better because in ensembles in later parts, you combine decision tress to make random forest or gbdt models.

Please plan how you will put hours per day to learn these + assignments in 5 weeks.
28/01/22, 10:37 am - +91 72648 49874: Let me know if I can help revise the concepts üëç
28/01/22, 10:53 am - +91 95582 32982: If all members are agree then I think we can schedule one revision session where all members attend live and someone whom finished content and interested to teach than that's benifits others
28/01/22, 10:53 am - +91 94529 09216: I am in

28/01/22, 10:57 am - +91 88003 13691: It is not possible to cover all syllabus in one session
28/01/22, 10:58 am - +91 88003 13691: We can go for each chapter
28/01/22, 10:58 am - +91 99165 48094: +1
28/01/22, 10:59 am - +91 77310 00298: I think it's better to revise from sub-1 because we will not have time later
28/01/22, 11:00 am - +91 95582 32982: That's good idea @918800313691
28/01/22, 11:02 am - +91 74149 09496: Its very helpful for me thank you so much üòä

28/01/22, 12:52 pm - +91 97411 84635: Hi Guys, what do you think about this idea of requesting about hard copes for our notes shared and the ebooks of each subject which got shared to us , so that it would be easy for us to reduce the screen time at the time revising and reading notes
28/01/22, 12:52 pm - +91 97411 84635: if any body is ok with this idea please drop a mail to them so that they may consider this
28/01/22, 1:06 pm - +91 88845 57276: That would be a lot of cost for them, don't think they will do it.

29/01/22, 4:44 pm - +91 72648 49874: is it KNN or Naive Bayes?
29/01/22, 4:46 pm - +91 79806 28509: Lets start with KNN, then we can again get back tomorrow for Naive Bayes?
29/01/22, 4:47 pm - +91 90324 45343: Knn
29/01/22, 4:47 pm - +91 72648 49874: ok, sorry @917980628509 : I did schedule the meeting for one day only! If everyone agrees I can make it for 2 days, but I thought we should keep Sunday evening free for our friends and family üôÇ
29/01/22, 4:47 pm - +91 72648 49874: so the schedule that I have set was for one day (every week Saturday 7-8:30 PM IST)
29/01/22, 4:48 pm - +91 72648 49874: for KNN I have created some overall notes.
29/01/22, 4:48 pm - +91 90324 45343: Can you please share
29/01/22, 4:49 pm - +91 72648 49874: of course. give me some time, so that I can export it as PDF, since I created it as a Jupyter notebook.
29/01/22, 4:52 pm - +91 98912 03778: There is a public live session of Srikant sir tomm 7 pm.. seems very relevant to our current topics.
29/01/22, 4:53 pm - +91 98912 03778: https://youtu.be/1FrmtEVznaA
29/01/22, 4:57 pm - +91 79806 28509: Ok, hope getting 1 hr in sunday will not hamper personal space, and yes, as we have srikanth sir's session, so can postpone, can we do somewhere in weekdays?
Reason i'm insisting is more sessions we attend, more connected, on track we will with course

30/01/22, 8:36 pm - +91 73825 54571: It is not about knowing the concept
But it is about understanding the concept and application to any kind of problem corresponding to that concept IS IMPORTANT 
You cannot let any of the thing that comes to ur mind while preparation  go just like that.clarify your doubts,apply it to new problems
ONLY to make a DIFFERENCE
30/01/22, 8:37 pm - +91 73825 54571: MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.

30/01/22, 11:06 pm - +91 72648 49874: None. They will notteach the attitude. Knowledge of tools will not help much. Convincing the stakeholders about the final model and to make the org data driven is an art, else there is no value addition.
30/01/22, 11:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: I thought you followed Krish Naik since you were mentioning ineuron
30/01/22, 11:08 pm - +91 72648 49874: No. But iNeuron is a good company with many good teachers. Krish can teach modelling but he never talks about data collection üò≠ My experience tells me that data engineering is quintessential. Garbage in is garbage out.
30/01/22, 11:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: Data collection given a business problem?
30/01/22, 11:13 pm - +91 89210 23935: Thank you üòÅ
30/01/22, 11:13 pm - +91 72648 49874: Even without one. Every business has problems. Question is whether they or we want to solve them using data effectively or not. Low hanging fruits may not necessarily need Machine learning. But quality data and making stakeholders understand things like a 5yr old is an art.
30/01/22, 11:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: What are the typical size of datasets you worked on?
30/01/22, 11:15 pm - +91 72648 49874: Terabytes.
30/01/22, 11:16 pm - +91 89210 23935: What machines do you use? Cloud instances or company infrastructure?
30/01/22, 11:16 pm - +91 72648 49874: But smaller ones as well provided the quality was good üëç
30/01/22, 11:17 pm - +91 88988 90243: Dada ek project summarise kardo 5 min me please
30/01/22, 11:17 pm - +91 72648 49874: For immense data, Google cloud. For regulars datacentre. The last one I used was on Oracle.
30/01/22, 11:19 pm - +91 72648 49874: Ok. 

Apna ops support team hai. unka last 13 months data was of somewhat good quality. 

After lot of analysis and political fights üòÇ we finally create an end to end pipeline for predicting which tickets will breach SLA. 

Data stored using Oracle. Data collected using APIs. Processing and machine learning using Python. POC was done using R.
30/01/22, 11:20 pm - +91 88988 90243: How did you deploy it to prod
30/01/22, 11:22 pm - +91 72648 49874: Sorry missed that part. Using AWS .
The solution runs every day and finds tickets which will breach. Finally we call an API to send SMS to ops team. üëç
30/01/22, 11:22 pm - +91 88988 90243: What's your accuracy
And what do you do if it comes down
30/01/22, 11:25 pm - +91 72648 49874: Average 85%. Model retraining is the key. Data mein bohut loopholes hain with quality. We ask development teams to improve them. In this specific case I have bo other option to improve model quality. 

Itna karne ke baad bhi my stakeholders question my team from time to time. Bolo.... üòÇ
30/01/22, 11:28 pm - +91 88988 90243: For sla breaching
What are the main features? 
I mean let's say ticket is considered non compliant when it is not resolved in 7 days
Then the tickets which are not resolved in 6 days will have high chance of being unresolved
Any other parameter you consider?

31/01/22, 12:12 am - +91 88988 90243: In this case 100 percentile won't exist right?
31/01/22, 12:14 am - Abhinaya Uoh Project: I can get your question
31/01/22, 12:15 am - +91 88988 90243: Why are you dividing by 2?
31/01/22, 12:16 am - Abhinaya Uoh Project: I thought we must take mean of the two values
31/01/22, 12:16 am - +91 88988 90243: You need to use linear interpolation
By your logic
11.1 rank will have same value as 11.9

31/01/22, 12:48 am - +91 88988 90243: If you have random state in your code just remove it
You will get different results
31/01/22, 12:49 am - +91 88988 90243: Train test split
31/01/22, 12:50 am - +91 88988 90243: This is not wrong
It means you have 100% accuracy
If you have trained on train data and getting 100% accuracy on test that means you don't have any outliers in your test data (decision surface is classifying the test data properly)
31/01/22, 12:52 am - +91 88988 90243: If you change random state parameter in train test split you will get different score for accuracy

31/01/22, 7:04 pm - +91 89210 23935: Hi,
I am fetching live data from a website that uses javascipt. So I'm using selenium with --headless mode. 
I want the interval to be EXACTLY 1 second, if the data is not fetched by 1 second, it should timeout and start fetching the data for next second correctly.
My function(page1) will fetch the data and returns a dataframe from page 1. 
10 such pages are there so I want to use multithreading as well.
Can anyone guide me approach/libraries for *scheduling* this so that my data fetching for these 10 webpages starts exactly at 00:00:00 and keeps collecting the data with EXACT 1 second interval 00:00:01, 00:00:02, 00:00:03 and so on for the entire day till 23:59:59.
31/01/22, 9:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: I just want to clear any misunderstandings. It's not an interview/work/freelance question. It's for a personal time series project.

02/02/22, 9:50 pm - +91 89783 80243: why we have to create bins equal to 2^no.of hyperplanes?. for each hyperplane we have either positive or negative will be the output. so total bins is equal to 2X no.of planes. please clarify the doubt
02/02/22, 9:51 pm - +91 89783 80243: in hashing table for assignment
02/02/22, 10:01 pm - +91 82371 27097: 2 possibilities for every hyperplane: positive and negative.
So total outcomes would be 2^j
Compare it to coin tosses.
1 toss: H, T (2)
2 tosses: HH, HT, TH, TT (4)
3 tosses: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT (8)
i.e. 2^(number of coin tosses)
02/02/22, 10:06 pm - +91 89783 80243: But we are not taking combinations. at a time we are taking one hyperplane
03/02/22, 12:05 am - +91 98933 88933: Each hyperplane is like adding a new dimension, with 2 hyperplanes you've 4 possible options (similar to x-y axis) when you consider 3 hyperplanes, it's like xyz axis which divides the space into 8 parts

05/02/22, 10:21 pm - +91 79806 28509: can anyone pls help with-
minmaxscaler vs standardscaler vs robustscaler
when to use which one?
05/02/22, 11:02 pm - +91 91762 75222: Why only 54 days available???

05/02/22, 11:16 pm - +91 79806 28509: so robustscalar is must to remove outliers, then can apply any of minmax or standardscalar?
05/02/22, 11:24 pm - +91 88988 90243: It would be helpful
Outliers can corrupt mean and variance significantly

06/02/22, 11:49 am - +91 81445 54148: One dumb question - probabilistic class label In knn says # no of negative class labels / tot no of class labels
06/02/22, 11:49 am - +91 81445 54148: Then what's the role of knn here.
06/02/22, 11:50 am - +91 81445 54148: Knn determines the appropriate class label through training - how this is related to probabilistic class label
06/02/22, 11:50 am - +91 81445 54148: Is it like an information to understand that our model prediction can be this percentage certain
06/02/22, 11:52 am - +91 94529 09216: KNN is just used to find the nearest neighbour to a point
06/02/22, 11:53 am - +91 81445 54148: Correct . How prob class label score plays a role
06/02/22, 11:53 am - +91 94529 09216: Based on this nearest neighbours you can solve classification problem by majority voting or even you can solve regression problem using mean/median
06/02/22, 11:53 am - +91 94529 09216: To interpret the model
06/02/22, 11:53 am - +91 94529 09216: ..
06/02/22, 11:53 am - +91 94529 09216: Yes

06/02/22, 6:24 pm - +91 81445 54148: In this how can the model determine the probability score as 0.9 , 0.6 ??
06/02/22, 6:25 pm - +91 81445 54148: I knew we had a lecture on probalisitic class label. 

Which tells the probalisitic score by (#no. Of negative class label /  # no of points).
06/02/22, 6:25 pm - +91 81445 54148: But this can be calculated per point

06/02/22, 6:31 pm - +91 93988 08159: The probability score here is the sigmoid(yi*WtXi) which will be between 0 and 1

08/02/22, 5:33 pm - +91 88988 90243: that was part of statistics course i think
08/02/22, 5:33 pm - +91 88988 90243: no separate project which i see

08/02/22, 11:43 pm - +91 88855 50259: There are algorithms which do anomaly detection. There is no anomaly detection topic as such.
08/02/22, 11:43 pm - +91 88855 50259: For instance local outlier factor can be used for anomaly detection
09/02/22, 11:49 am - +91 95370 26661: Hey guys, I need some help.
How to save output of a model into dictionary?
For example I am running an image classification model where it classifies 3 things. 
Any idea how I save that output in a dictionary form where it has the image name and it's classification output?
09/02/22, 11:49 am - +91 95370 26661: Any kind of help would be appreciated. Thank you
09/02/22, 11:54 am - +91 95582 32982: Which framework u used?
Tensorflow/ PyTorch
09/02/22, 12:18 pm - +91 72648 49874: Loop through each output prediction and append values in a dictionary üëç if you have high volume of data then use iterators üëç

09/02/22, 12:32 pm - +91 95370 26661: Yeah even i thought the same. But how to append in this format
09/02/22, 12:33 pm - +91 95370 26661: Dict1= {
'filename': 'classification output' , ........ }

@919537026661 üëç
09/02/22, 12:42 pm - +91 95370 26661: Thank you. I'll try this once.
09/02/22, 12:44 pm - +91 72648 49874: Simply, put all values in a list inside the loop and then finally append in the dictionary üëç
09/02/22, 12:44 pm - +91 95370 26661: Yeah but what I want is each filename has their own classification label. Here it says the classification label will be the key and the filenames will be the values.
09/02/22, 12:52 pm - +91 95370 26661: Like here in the link it says the output will be 1 key which will be the classification label and then a list of values with the filenames. But what I want is one key and one filename or each output.
09/02/22, 2:12 pm - +91 91762 75222: Hi guys, just now I got an idea. If you guys have any queries, please post that in stackoverflow, and share the link here in which you posted in stackoverflow, so we can answer it.

14/02/22, 9:43 am - +91 95603 55228: Hi, about logistics regression assignment, i am stuck in log loss function. i implemented but grader function is not showing success. please suggest some solution.
14/02/22, 9:47 am - +91 91762 75222: Even I'm in same situation
14/02/22, 9:51 am - +91 79806 28509: Pls share the error screenshot
14/02/22, 9:59 am - +91 95603 55228: There is no error. I implemented log-loss function.

14/02/22, 10:11 am - +91 77748 96465: Guys can any1 tell if you guys are able to revise course 1 and 2 along with course 3 content?
I'm bit struggling to manage both
14/02/22, 10:11 am - +91 95603 55228: trying to complete course 3 first
14/02/22, 10:12 am - +91 89715 68712: Same boat üòí
14/02/22, 10:21 am - +91 79806 28509: Have u completed course 3 ?
14/02/22, 10:22 am - +91 77748 96465: Nope
14/02/22, 10:25 am - +91 79806 28509: Until mid term3, suggest should be focusing on only course 3, later would get 1 week time for each course
14/02/22, 10:26 am - +91 77748 96465: Ya I was thinking of that only ..because this course is very important
14/02/22, 10:27 am - +91 77748 96465: Thanks for suggestionsüëçüèª

15/02/22, 9:57 am - +91 83449 80933: Small doubt ‚ùì 

To fetch data in pandas do we need to have the data frame folder inside the anaconda or else anywhere in the directory?
15/02/22, 10:02 am - +91 95582 32982: Anywhere. Just provide File path
15/02/22, 10:04 am - +91 95603 55228: This message was deleted
15/02/22, 10:05 am - +91 95603 55228: anywhere, path should be correct. its easy if keep df on same folder of anaconda. then you can access directly without giving full path.
15/02/22, 10:36 am - +91 83449 80933: Sometimes it's shows permission denied
15/02/22, 10:36 am - +91 83449 80933: Yeah, it works good
15/02/22, 10:40 am - +91 72648 49874: Surely this is on Windows üòé it always has such issues
15/02/22, 10:43 am - +91 83449 80933: Yes, also if we have the same files of two copies, it's not working with one path but working with another path
15/02/22, 10:51 am - +91 95603 55228: have anyone completed logistic regression mandatory assignment?
15/02/22, 10:54 am - +91 83449 80933: <Media omitted>
15/02/22, 10:55 am - +91 95603 55228: have you kept df on same folder?

15/02/22, 10:56 am - +91 95603 55228: looks like your py file and df are in different location..
15/02/22, 10:56 am - +91 70877 58526: How are you referring to the dataset?
15/02/22, 10:58 am - +91 83449 80933: I have two zipped files inside the anaconda folder... training_variants df works well but not training_text df
15/02/22, 11:00 am - +91 95603 55228: please share line of code that you are using for access training_text

15/02/22, 11:05 am - +91 95603 55228: if your python file and training on same folder then no need to give full path. it works fine just df name.
15/02/22, 11:08 am - +91 83449 80933: Not work this too

16/02/22, 9:16 am - +91 98209 18938: Thanks
16/02/22, 8:05 pm - +91 70877 58526: Hey guys anyone else who is having difficulty in understanding the SVM
16/02/22, 8:06 pm - +91 70877 58526: Initially I understood but after the dual form lecture things have just stopped making sense
16/02/22, 8:06 pm - +91 70877 58526: Anyone who has good reference for that?
16/02/22, 8:07 pm - +91 88988 90243: Ek revise session karte he weekend
16/02/22, 8:07 pm - +91 70877 58526: Yes plz, much needed
16/02/22, 8:07 pm - +91 70877 58526: I feel like the course is being less side on practical.
16/02/22, 8:11 pm - +91 72648 49874: Sure
16/02/22, 8:12 pm - +91 72648 49874: Correctly spotted üëç
16/02/22, 8:13 pm - +91 94529 09216: https://towardsdatascience.com/truly-understanding-the-kernel-trick-1aeb11560769
16/02/22, 8:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: There is an optional assignment called "behaviour of linear models" if you want an applied ai assignment regarding this.
Also "Naive Bayes on Donor choose dataset" to apply text preprocessing, vectorization, and training an ML model.
Also "compute performance metrics without sklearn" will also be good if you want to practice python
16/02/22, 8:24 pm - +91 89210 23935: In applied ai course, these are mandatory and there is so much practical to learn. Especially applying "NB on donor choose dataset" gives you more clarity
16/02/22, 8:27 pm - +91 77748 96465: Thanks for suggestions
16/02/22, 8:27 pm - +91 77748 96465: I think we should consider optional asisgnments as mandatory to excel in this course
16/02/22, 8:28 pm - +91 77748 96465: Else we will just learn theoryüòÖ
16/02/22, 8:30 pm - +91 75690 61914: I felt the same. I have rewatched the videos 2-3 times to get understand the concepts
16/02/22, 8:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah some assignments are frustrating but it's worth it
16/02/22, 8:38 pm - +91 72648 49874: Related to SVM.

Imagine you are standing in front of a ball.

You can now see around 48% of the ball's surface area. 

Now I have deliberately put another smaller ball in your line of sight. 

To see the first ball properly what would you do?

Change the position üòé

This is the basic idea behind kernel trick in SVM. 

By creating higher order functions to represent the data, the model achieves the decision hyperplane by merely changing the perspective.

16/02/22, 11:33 pm - +91 83300 49953: That's true, but managing work + diploma content is already extremely challenging. How to make time for kaggle too?
16/02/22, 11:41 pm - +91 89210 23935: If you can manage to do "Apply Naive Bayes on Donor Choose Dataset" optional assignment, it will give you good practical exposure. You will learn to clean the data, convert real world text to words, cross validation, training, testing etc.. it's a good nlp problem as well as a business problem. Once you do it with naive Bayes, you can do it with other models also like gbdt, decision trees etc..

17/02/22, 2:20 pm - +91 91236 65827: Hi All
In LSH implementation assignment how to get the class label for the points in neighbouring. I have got all the points in neighborhood from the hash table but have issue in getting their class label to take the majority.
17/02/22, 2:20 pm - +91 91236 65827: If anyone can guide plz
17/02/22, 2:22 pm - +91 93988 08159: In those neighbourhood apply knn
17/02/22, 2:22 pm - +91 93988 08159: That*
17/02/22, 3:36 pm - +91 83449 80933: I'm stuck with preprocessing in Tf-idf... 
The problem is in the output it merges one list[-1] + another list[0] as one string also I used to remove punctuations but it doesn't behave as it is
17/02/22, 3:38 pm - +91 83449 80933: OUTPUT : ['This!!', 'is', 'the', 'first', 'document', 'mostlythis', 'd@ocument', 'is', 'the', 'second', 'documentand', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'third', 'oneis', 'this', 'the', 'first', 'document', 'here']
17/02/22, 4:03 pm - +91 89783 80243: Have u copied all the values into a new dictionary?.
17/02/22, 4:29 pm - +91 83300 49953: I'm only getting 50 percent accuracy for LSH assignment, do we need 100 percent accuracy?
17/02/22, 4:30 pm - +91 73825 54571: We should get More than 80%
17/02/22, 4:32 pm - +91 83300 49953: But doesn't accuracy depend on the hyperplanes? 
But they are random
17/02/22, 4:37 pm - +91 89783 80243: I think u also did the same mistake done by me.

For train data u have to use fit_transform, for test data u have to use only transform.

Then u will get 90% accuracy if u r code is correct.
17/02/22, 4:38 pm - +91 83300 49953: Ohhh, thank you so much.  Can you also tell me the difference between them both?
17/02/22, 4:40 pm - +91 89783 80243: We are fitting the train data with mean and variance in a distribution.

For test data it will take those same mean and variance of train data..if we again use fit for test data ,it will take new mean and variance.

Restart your notebook, again re run your code, without any changes in code, you'll same numbers to be generated

17/02/22, 5:58 pm - +91 91762 75222: That's why in LSH assignment, they have given numpy seed as 0, and they told us write code below seed line and they have mentioned don't change the seed value also

 change those 5 values to +1 if number  greater than 0 and - 1 if number less than 0

So use this array of 5 values as key in ur dictionary and append data point in ur key-value pair

Repeat the steps for every data point, in LSH dictionary you'll get 32 keys, if we generate 5 random planes

19/02/22, 1:03 pm - +91 88845 57276: Anybody here from non cs background?
19/02/22, 1:04 pm - +91 78935 55163: Distinct words are help in  IDF calculation
19/02/22, 1:05 pm - +91 92058 52308: +1
19/02/22, 1:06 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yup

19/02/22, 5:05 pm - +91 72648 49874: Hi all

I will start the zoom call today on time for all to join and discuss doubts. 

Today's topic can be limited to LSH and Logistic regression.

19/02/22, 6:29 pm - +91 95582 32982: Does anyone implement logistics regression assignment?
19/02/22, 6:32 pm - +91 72648 49874: We may start 10 minutes late because of Shivaji Jayanti üëç
19/02/22, 6:41 pm - +91 94039 54082: Me too
19/02/22, 6:45 pm - +91 78935 55163: Hi Prithvi, how will get 32 values, as we are Looping through train datapoints it should be 2215 right
19/02/22, 6:46 pm - +91 82371 27097: We are looking through 5 hyperplanes. So we will have 2^5 = 32 values
19/02/22, 6:47 pm - +91 91762 75222: These train data points will belong to some bucket... We'll have 32 buckets... Because 2^5 =32
19/02/22, 6:47 pm - +91 78935 55163: But we also loop on train data set after tfidd
19/02/22, 6:48 pm - +91 78935 55163: Which has 2215 rowa
19/02/22, 6:48 pm - +91 78935 55163: Rows*
19/02/22, 6:48 pm - +91 82371 27097: Yes, when we loop through the train data, every data point will have one of these 32 values / buckets
19/02/22, 6:48 pm - +91 91762 75222: Yes we have to loop and find which bucket does each data point
19/02/22, 6:48 pm - +91 91762 75222: Each data point belongs
19/02/22, 6:49 pm - +91 78935 55163: I got the correct result, but not able to interpret logical how we will get 32
19/02/22, 6:51 pm - +91 91762 75222: Did you create LSH table?
Because you are telling you got correct answer
19/02/22, 6:51 pm - +91 78935 55163: Yes
19/02/22, 6:52 pm - +91 78935 55163: I created it
19/02/22, 6:52 pm - +91 91762 75222: OK good... Then how many keys were there in ur LSH dictionary???
19/02/22, 6:52 pm - +91 78935 55163: Len of keys are 32

19/02/22, 6:53 pm - +91 91762 75222: Then this is what we are telling... We'll have 32 buckets
19/02/22, 6:54 pm - +91 78935 55163: Yes it got 32, I am not clear how we 32, as we are Looping on train data set rows of 2215
19/02/22, 6:55 pm - +91 78935 55163: For each rows we are getting dot product for 5 random plans
19/02/22, 6:56 pm - +91 78935 55163: So hash table should contain 2215 rows ?
19/02/22, 7:03 pm - +91 82371 27097: Hashtable will not have rows. It will either be a dictionary with 32 keys or a list of length 32.
19/02/22, 7:04 pm - +91 82371 27097: Each key will store all the points that belong to the same bucket, i.e. neighborhood
19/02/22, 7:08 pm - +91 72648 49874: Is anyone joining the session?
19/02/22, 7:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: I tried joining
19/02/22, 7:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: It is asking for passcode

19/02/22, 7:23 pm - +91 94529 09216: Got it
19/02/22, 7:51 pm - +91 91762 75222: Yes hash table will definitely contain 2215 indices... Which will be splitted in 32 buckets
19/02/22, 7:54 pm - +91 91762 75222: Some bucket might contain 1 data poiny, some other bucket might contain 10 data points, so it is completely random,

Which bucket contains how many elements will be dependent on their feature and 5 random planes normal vector
19/02/22, 8:19 pm - +91 78935 55163: Got it
19/02/22, 8:50 pm - +91 83300 49953: Hey I just had a query for those who are already working in data science. 
Is it worth it to quit your job and pursue an offline masters degree in data science or is it better to study online ( like an online masters degree) along with doing a data science job? 
This is of course if the end goal is to work in the industry itself, not research.
19/02/22, 8:51 pm - +91 88988 90243: Both options are good
Assuming you are going to good university
19/02/22, 8:56 pm - +91 83300 49953: Ohh, okay. Thanks
19/02/22, 9:28 pm - +91 72648 49874: i would rather suggest for online options unless you are already enrolled in our PGD UOH program from Applied Roots. Other options include UpGrad and Great Lakes. Both are equally good with great teachers. üôÇ

20/02/22, 12:38 am - +91 73825 54571: Is this normal.? Should I wait
20/02/22, 12:38 am - +91 78935 55163: Which assignment?
20/02/22, 12:38 am - +91 73825 54571: LR
20/02/22, 12:38 am - +91 78935 55163: Sorry not sure
20/02/22, 12:39 am - +91 73825 54571: For LSH then
20/02/22, 12:39 am - +91 78935 55163: For LSH I am currently working
20/02/22, 12:39 am - +91 78935 55163: Working fine If I ran tfidf
20/02/22, 12:40 am - +91 73825 54571: Ok thnku
20/02/22, 7:28 am - +91 91762 75222: No it won't take that much time... It'll complete in few minutes
20/02/22, 7:29 am - +91 91762 75222: Are you checking for the tolerance
20/02/22, 7:29 am - +91 73825 54571: Yes
20/02/22, 7:30 am - +91 91762 75222: Print loss for every epoch
20/02/22, 7:30 am - +91 91762 75222: Check if loss is decreasing
20/02/22, 7:31 am - +91 73825 54571: Okay
20/02/22, 8:16 am - +91 78756 85040: Are you executing on Local machine or Colab?
20/02/22, 8:30 am - +91 73825 54571: Colab
20/02/22, 8:34 am - +91 96666 32574: Did anyone get link for today's class
20/02/22, 8:37 am - +91 73825 54571: I think we must raise mail asking them to address our concern regarding weekend live sessions and that should be more related to course content.
(We have shown unity incase of exam postponement, its time to show unity again, time once passed we can't get again)
20/02/22, 8:40 am - +91 73825 54571: These all recorded videos are available on YouTube
I really don't know what extra they are providing as content for our fee.(for assignments? Or for login credentials?)
20/02/22, 8:42 am - +91 77748 96465: I dnt think these videos are available on YouTube
20/02/22, 8:42 am - +91 77748 96465: Only few free videos are available
20/02/22, 8:45 am - +91 73825 54571: Most of them are
20/02/22, 8:45 am - +91 73825 54571: This is disheartening 
Not even one session on Machine Learning
20/02/22, 8:45 am - +91 98912 03778: https://youtu.be/slb2PBC0SBY
20/02/22, 8:47 am - +91 98912 03778: Has anyone received airmeet link for this event.. kindly share..
20/02/22, 8:47 am - +91 84476 21501: Agree and one more thing what i think,applied covers mostly theory part and dont have practical cases,they give us assignment but atleast in live session they should cover atleast 1 use case step by step so that we have direction to go for assignment..i am not sure everyone are feeling same or not but personally at this time i am feeling same..
20/02/22, 8:48 am - +91 73825 54571: Interview questions is important but not at this point of time
20/02/22, 8:49 am - +91 73825 54571: They must have given priority to optional casestudy atleast
As to make students ensure they have  exposure to realtime
20/02/22, 9:03 am - +91 89783 80243: I too feel the same.theory part is good, application of that in real world scenario is missing.
20/02/22, 9:04 am - +91 88988 90243: You can go through case studies
20/02/22, 9:10 am - +91 89783 80243: But after completing the particular topic. if we can know about it at the end, it is easy to correlate.

Preparatory course has the good structure.at the end of topic, quiz is there to assess what we have understood about the topic.

20/02/22, 9:23 pm - +91 70877 58526: Hy guys, there is a question on standardising the column after tfidf conversation. But I believe since after log in IDF we have already transformed the scale, why would we further standardize the results?
20/02/22, 9:23 pm - +91 70877 58526: Conversion*
20/02/22, 9:30 pm - +91 96505 18893: I am also confused about it.
20/02/22, 9:31 pm - +91 96505 18893: Can someone explain this?
20/02/22, 9:32 pm - +91 70877 58526: Does the relation between 2 vector representation is distance between them and thus when calculating distance we apply the standardization
20/02/22, 9:34 pm - +91 70877 58526: I understand for logistic reg we require columns to be standardized but had does the standardization to columns in general is necessary?
20/02/22, 9:49 pm - +91 98933 88933: The log scaling of IDF was done because we multiply tf and idf, tf is always between 0 and 1 while IDF can be any number (N/ni) hence we applied log(N/Ni) so that importance of idf is reduced and both tf and idf get significant importance

The column standardization ensures that each column (here each column is a particular word in the text) gets equal representation

However here, each column means the same thing (multiplication of term freq. and inverse document freq.) so it's not like one column is weight in KGs and other is height in CMs, each column represents the same thing (tf*idf)

Hence, I don't think standardization was required here, as a matter of fact, standardization is centering and scaling and is designed for numerical features (because they've mean and variance), for one hot encoded features or tfidf features, standardization doesn't make natural sense (Reference: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/33730/should-i-rescale-tfidf-features)
20/02/22, 9:50 pm - +91 98933 88933: Standardization/normalization is required in each algorithm that deals in distance (like KNN, logistic regression, linear regression), for algorithms not requiring actual distance like decision trees, it can be completely skipped
20/02/22, 9:50 pm - +91 70877 58526: Thank you for the answer , it totally makes sense but in the assignment it has been asked to apply column standardization.
20/02/22, 9:51 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes, I felt it weird too
20/02/22, 9:51 pm - +91 98933 88933: One more positive effect of standardization is that it helps gradient descent to converge faster
20/02/22, 9:52 pm - +91 98933 88933: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/437840/in-machine-learning-how-does-normalization-help-in-convergence-of-gradient-desc
20/02/22, 9:52 pm - +91 98933 88933: Maybe because of this reason, they asked us to standardize the data
20/02/22, 9:56 pm - +91 72181 64871: Thanks for the reference!

23/02/22, 2:53 pm - +91 96505 18893: I am little lost in logistic regression assignment... In custom_train(). Can anyone help me in understand a little? The whole thing is looking a little daunting.
23/02/22, 2:54 pm - +91 95603 55228: where are you stuck in.custom train?
23/02/22, 2:59 pm - +91 96505 18893: actually I am not able to understand it whole ... Like what do I need to in it ... do I need to make SGD? and if yes how ..... assignment is looking too far from the theory which was there in the videos.

23/02/22, 3:07 pm - +91 98933 88933: At the end of the assignment, there's a function implemented by the team "custom_train_v2()"
23/02/22, 3:07 pm - +91 98933 88933: A similar implementation has to be done except the update in learning rate part
23/02/22, 3:10 pm - +91 96505 18893: Thanks that's a great help..

23/02/22, 11:39 pm - +91 98315 06503: Use stopwords
23/02/22, 11:44 pm - +91 91131 88923: Stop words will it increase accuracy?
23/02/22, 11:44 pm - +91 91131 88923: Y_grader values are not matching Y_custom
23/02/22, 11:45 pm - +91 91131 88923: Only 6 values are matching so I am seeing 60% accuracy.
23/02/22, 11:49 pm - +91 98315 06503: Yes. Experiment with other techniques likes upsampling or using ngrams
23/02/22, 11:50 pm - +91 98315 06503: Or any other thing which can increase accuracy
23/02/22, 11:50 pm - +91 98315 06503: Everyone gets 60 % initially
23/02/22, 11:53 pm - +91 91131 88923: Ya I am trying different combination max I got was 70%.
23/02/22, 11:54 pm - +91 98315 06503: I was able to increase till 90
24/02/22, 12:02 am - +91 91131 88923: Which combination did you try?
24/02/22, 1:00 am - +91 98315 06503: data balancing and using stopwords
24/02/22, 8:42 am - +91 91762 75222: Create multiple LSH tables... Don't just create 1 LSH table and predict accuracy
24/02/22, 8:47 am - +91 77748 96465: Guys I'm struggling to create a hash table....can anyone given some idea or pointer about it?
24/02/22, 9:08 am - +91 83300 49953: Hii venkatesh, in LSH question, we were told to take 5 hyperplanes. These five hyperplanes split our entire space into 2^5 parts. Each of these parts are our keys for the hash table and every point from the same part has the same key. 
Now, to find the key, we use the concept that we learnt in the first chapter - if point lies below the hyper plane then wTx < 0. If point lies above the hyper plane then wTx >0. 
So for each point in our dataset x, we compute wTx. This you can also find in the notes btw. For eg, a random data point will have key as (-1, +1, -1,+1, +1) -  this is just an example. +1 means wTx > 0 and -1 is vice versa. To find w, the steps are mentioned in the assignment notebook itself. 
Hope this helps.
24/02/22, 9:14 am - +91 77748 96465: Hi Aditya... thank you for explaining...but my apologies I did not mention clearly...but I wanted to know how to create hash table programmatically..
We have to take (+1,+1,-1,-1,+1) (eg) as key and the points as values right?
But then how should we keep appending the points in the values of hashtables as we go on checking wTx for each point?
24/02/22, 9:48 am - +91 91762 75222: Instead of using the point, it's better to use the point's index, and append the indices

24/02/22, 12:08 pm - +91 94529 09216: There is mistake
24/02/22, 12:08 pm - +91 96505 18893: Did that‚Ä¶ it is 1/1+np.exp(-z)
24/02/22, 12:08 pm - +91 96505 18893: Is it wrong?
24/02/22, 12:09 pm - +91 94529 09216: Sorry let me see check again
24/02/22, 12:09 pm - +91 96505 18893: My z is giving me type object
24/02/22, 12:10 pm - +91 96505 18893: May be z is coming as sparse matrix.
24/02/22, 12:22 pm - +91 95603 55228: sparse matrix doesnt allow for iteration so you have to convert x in dense matrix
24/02/22, 12:23 pm - +91 95603 55228: train vector stand is sparse matrix...you have to convert it into dense matrix by uaing toarray()
24/02/22, 1:16 pm - +91 96505 18893: should I convert it in the TFIDF function?
24/02/22, 1:23 pm - +91 95603 55228: you can...i did it
24/02/22, 1:25 pm - +91 96505 18893: Yes I tried it things are moving now
24/02/22, 1:25 pm - +91 96505 18893: Thanks

24/02/22, 3:28 pm - +91 96505 18893: Any suggestions for grader function throwing assertion in logistics regression. Should I make changes in TFIDF function?
24/02/22, 3:30 pm - +91 95603 55228: you are getting this error because condition is not true as per assert.. try to find issue in custom_train function...
24/02/22, 3:32 pm - +91 96505 18893: Okay
24/02/22, 4:50 pm - +91 83449 80933: In IDF, should ignore stop words?
24/02/22, 6:14 pm - +91 99998 58727: Ideally it will make stop words close to 1 and taking log will reduce their affect to minimal

25/02/22, 11:05 am - +91 73825 54571: Q. Ways to avoid overfitting

A. Some steps that we can take to avoid it:

1. Data augmentation

2. L1/L2 Regularization

3. Remove layers / number of units per layer

4. Cross-validation


Q.  What Is Interpolation And Extrapolation?

A. Interpolation is the process of calculating the unknown value from known given values whereas extrapolation is the process of calculating unknown values beyond the given data points.





Q.  How do you handle null values and which Imputation method is more favorable?

A. Ways to handle missing values in the dataset:

Deleting Rows with missing values.

Impute missing values for continuous variable.

Impute missing values for categorical variable.

Other Imputation Methods.

Using Algorithms that support missing values.

Prediction of missing values.

Multiple imputation is more advantageous than the single imputation because it uses several complete data sets and provides both the within-imputation and between-imputation variability.

25/02/22, 4:43 pm - +91 70734 10928: Can we request them to extend the deadline for assignment submissions so we can do optional assignments as well because due to the exam preparation it is difficult to complete all the optional assignment if we want to learn more we should ask them for this...what you all suggest?
25/02/22, 4:44 pm - +91 95603 55228: check your gradient dw method, difference should be  less  than 0.02.
25/02/22, 5:15 pm - +91 73825 54571: Okay
25/02/22, 5:15 pm - +91 73825 54571: Is there deadline for optional assignments too?
25/02/22, 5:16 pm - +91 78935 18350: No deadline for optionals
25/02/22, 5:34 pm - +91 70734 10928: I think sir was saying in one of live session that we have to complete all the assignment before this semester end
25/02/22, 5:35 pm - +91 77748 96465: All mandatory assignments
25/02/22, 5:35 pm - +91 77748 96465: Only
25/02/22, 5:35 pm - +91 75690 61914: No. That's for mandatory assignments not for optinal one's

25/02/22, 5:35 pm - +91 97688 02223: Is anyone in touch with students from previously batch
25/02/22, 5:35 pm - +91 97688 02223: To know about the placements and support after the course
25/02/22, 5:37 pm - +91 75690 61914: As per my knowledge, I believe we need to complete only mandatory assignments before semester exam not optional assignments.
25/02/22, 5:37 pm - +91 70734 10928: I think we should ask them via mail..
25/02/22, 5:38 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes, please knows about placements of first batch students?
25/02/22, 5:38 pm - +91 90071 50601: +1. We should mail about fee payment date extension + details of batch 1. A draft with consent of all.
25/02/22, 5:38 pm - +91 70734 10928: How many got placed from there batch?

25/02/22, 9:45 pm - +91 89210 23935: Only mandatory assignment needed to be completed before semester end. There is no reason for them to remove the optional assignments. Infact these optional assignments were added by someone's request during a live session.
25/02/22, 9:49 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think 500 rs is certificate fee, maybe that's why 500 rs difference

27/02/22, 11:27 am - +91 73825 54571: someone posted that they have requested in the mail asking them to postpone fee due date, can that person post that draft here
27/02/22, 11:30 am - +91 95813 23427: if all us mail them, i think they will revise the end dates to pay the fee.
27/02/22, 11:31 am - +91 73825 54571: yes
27/02/22, 11:45 am - +91 70877 58526: Hi, I am reaching the accuracy 63% in logistic assignment. can you please help me I don't know what I am doing wrong
27/02/22, 11:46 am - +91 73825 54571: Hello Sir,
I got a mail from AppliedRoots team asking us to pay second term fee before March 3rd,2022.
we did not even start with first term end exams ,as a student from AppliedRoots batch-2 I would like to please you to extend the due date for second term fee till this march month end or in April first week i.e, after completion of first term end exams.
Thankyou.
27/02/22, 11:47 am - +91 73825 54571: people who are intrested can send this to mentors via mail
27/02/22, 11:47 am - +91 95813 23427: done
27/02/22, 11:47 am - +91 96505 18893: Sure
27/02/22, 11:52 am - +91 89210 23935: I'm disappointed that live sessions are not regular. Last time when it was conducted, it was conducted for other students too, last discussion on last session was about sparkml. Shouldn't there be dedicated live sessions for us every week?
27/02/22, 11:54 am - +91 73825 54571: what are the topics do u think they should take for live session
27/02/22, 11:56 am - +91 89210 23935: Regardless of what I think, topics on ML and doubt clearance should be there.
27/02/22, 11:57 am - +91 73825 54571: he says that if we have doubt we should comment or mail them, if we ask topics related to ML he says cant repeat,if we repeat also we have to explain the same thing
27/02/22, 11:58 am - +91 75690 61914: Hi Team,

We were communicated that the second term fee along with the diploma certificate of 39,500 rs has to be paid by March 3rd, 2022.

As this month is time for our Tax deductions for the working professionals and you gave us the very limited time of 5 days for the same. so planning the amount in such a short span of time is very hard for us.
It would have been good if you have communicated at least 15-20 days prior to the deadline so that we would have planned the expenses/Tax deductions etc. I request you to consider this and extend the final deadline for the second term fee payment.
27/02/22, 11:59 am - +91 75690 61914: <Media omitted>
27/02/22, 12:00 pm - +91 73825 54571: how much time did they take to get back to u
27/02/22, 12:01 pm - +91 75690 61914: 2 hours
27/02/22, 12:03 pm - +91 73825 54571: In the last session  srikanth sir told he is thinking to conduct interview quests based on individual topics seperately,i asked him to conduct session on particular model so as to make us able to understand real world scenario
27/02/22, 12:07 pm - +91 72648 49874: There should be live sessions basis E2E project implementation. That's the main thing we will need in the industry right now - problem solvers! that's why there is such a gap of skills for DS and ML or DL.
27/02/22, 12:07 pm - +91 72181 64871: Agreed!!
27/02/22, 12:07 pm - +91 72181 64871: Yes üôåüèª
27/02/22, 12:08 pm - +91 73825 54571: super
27/02/22, 12:11 pm - +91 99998 58727: Agreed. Sessions should be regular else it would be same as recorded course!
27/02/22, 12:12 pm - +91 99998 58727: Anyone asked do we have any session today?
27/02/22, 12:12 pm - +91 72648 49874: I did but waiting reply
27/02/22, 12:12 pm - +91 89210 23935: Last week I asked. Can't ask every week. They should tell in advance
27/02/22, 12:14 pm - +91 89210 23935: Didn't saw any YouTube announcement, slack announcement or email. So probably no
27/02/22, 12:14 pm - +91 72648 49874: I agree. There is no communication as of now on this.
27/02/22, 12:15 pm - +91 73825 54571: Not conducting any session isn't fair
27/02/22, 12:21 pm - +91 98859 04893: Yes also, we are not having sessions from uoh professors as promised, no seperate session for batch2,  I am not able to catchup live interview sessions as I am bit behind, and its all recorded sessions for me
27/02/22, 12:21 pm - +91 99599 32345: I think we should all drop an email regarding live sessions. Atleast one session should happen every week. ML/AI is a broad topic and live sessions will help us improve real time understanding. Else this is nothing different to Applied course.
27/02/22, 12:21 pm - +91 75690 61914: +1
27/02/22, 12:24 pm - +91 89210 23935: Agreed. If they can't conduct a live session this week, there should be email informing regarding this. We have to expect last minute emails every Saturday and Sunday and there will be no sessions.
27/02/22, 12:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: It should be at sat 11 am as it was before.
27/02/22, 12:26 pm - +91 99599 32345: Yes
27/02/22, 12:27 pm - +91 89715 68712: I feel applied ai course is better than this course. Because the assignments were mandatory, and i learnt a lot from doing those and that's how I ended up in data science job. But here only 2-3, and lots of theory.
27/02/22, 12:29 pm - +91 98859 04893: I echo you
27/02/22, 12:31 pm - +91 99451 11649: I too agree..appliedai have lot of hands on
27/02/22, 12:31 pm - +91 99998 58727: But those assignments we have as optional so one can do along with theory for freshers
27/02/22, 12:33 pm - +91 99998 58727: You can always skip theory if you know the some part of it
27/02/22, 12:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think diploma is better tho. There won't be good student interaction like this in applied ai course. Everyone goes in their on pace and if we actively pursue maybe we can find similar students. 
Contents are also more deep in diploma. Atleast in course 1 and 2 .
Live sessions in applied ai course is more useful once we complete a lot of topics, but we used to have weekly live session, and it was an advantage. But these live sessions are not regular now a days, so that's a problem.

27/02/22, 12:42 pm - +91 89210 23935: The mindset that assignment has to be done to get course completion pushes you to do all the assignment in applied ai course. That push is not here in diploma since they are optional assignments. But it's a mental barrier one has to overcome.
27/02/22, 12:42 pm - +91 99998 58727: Correct we have more content in this as per the team. And they solve doubts too on mail or comments so there I don‚Äôt find any problem. 

The only thing lacking is fix schedule earlier it was fixed 11 am Saturday and same we can mail them to fix this for batch 2
27/02/22, 12:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: True. True

28/02/22, 12:13 pm - +91 73825 54571: By using n-grams(with n>1) 
Why the dimension increases.
Im unable to understand this point.
What I think is we can reduce the dimension by using n-gram(with n>1)
28/02/22, 12:20 pm - +91 96505 18893: N grams will increase because they make all possible pairs ‚Ä¶ if there are 3 words 1 gram will have 3 features but 2 gram will have all possible pairs 3C2
28/02/22, 12:20 pm - +91 73825 54571: Yes
28/02/22, 12:20 pm - +91 82371 27097: I had the same question actually. But since you give an ngram range, it is bound to be greater than n
28/02/22, 12:20 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Dimension increases because you'll have many combinations
28/02/22, 12:20 pm - +91 96505 18893: This is what I understood let me know if i misunderstood

28/02/22, 12:31 pm - +91 82371 27097: I thought ngrams only pair consecutive words, to avoid situations like difference between verb and not+verb. Is my understanding wrong?
28/02/22, 12:35 pm - +91 78756 85040: Does ngram consider semantics?
28/02/22, 12:35 pm - +91 78756 85040: I guess No it's doesn't
28/02/22, 12:35 pm - +91 78756 85040: *it doesn't
28/02/22, 12:38 pm - +91 98933 88933: N gram only pairs consecutive words, pairing far off words doesn't make logical sense
28/02/22, 12:39 pm - +91 79806 28509: Yes, only sequential wirds
28/02/22, 12:39 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes you're right, No semantics
28/02/22, 12:39 pm - +91 82371 27097: Thanks
28/02/22, 12:40 pm - +91 98933 88933: Dimensions usually increase because we use 1gram + 2gram + 3 gram
28/02/22, 12:42 pm - +91 90003 24850: Is anyone got link for mock test of subject 3?

28/02/22, 12:50 pm - +91 97912 22474: Guys, after the first semester, will get a certificate of the first semester marks sheet or will we only get it at the end of 2 semesters
28/02/22, 12:50 pm - +91 82371 27097: It's giving the summary option directly. So it was the one they offered before the first midterm as a sample test
28/02/22, 12:52 pm - +91 79806 28509: Ok, so it has course 1 questions only?
28/02/22, 12:52 pm - +91 82371 27097: Yeah not even course 1 questions. Just random check to get us acquainted with the UI
28/02/22, 12:52 pm - +91 97912 22474: If we miss semester end exam, will we have to repeat the entire course next semester or will we have the option only to write semester exam

28/02/22, 12:57 pm - +91 79806 28509: Thx, they mailed that mock test will be available on 27th 9 AM, which still not post 24 hrs...

28/02/22, 2:13 pm - +91 97912 22474: And this
28/02/22, 2:14 pm - +91 95813 23427: need to wait till next batch
28/02/22, 2:15 pm - +91 97912 22474: Do we need to rewrite mid term exam as well
28/02/22, 2:16 pm - +91 75690 61914: I believe just like how our graduation semesters are, we need to treat them like backlogs and write it with next batch. Anyhow we will be having course access to 2 years
28/02/22, 2:16 pm - +91 95813 23427: I think clearing them once is enough
28/02/22, 2:16 pm - +91 97912 22474: Oh okay
28/02/22, 2:17 pm - +91 97912 22474: Okay.
28/02/22, 2:17 pm - +91 75690 61914: This is what I believe not offical confirmation. If you drop a mail to the team they might come with right solution
28/02/22, 2:17 pm - +91 97912 22474: Oh ok
28/02/22, 2:36 pm - +91 73825 54571: Are they responding to queries  from last two days
28/02/22, 2:38 pm - +91 98209 18938: Something has happened seems with in the applied root team..
28/02/22, 2:38 pm - +91 98209 18938: Not responding
28/02/22, 2:39 pm - +65 8337 3637: No, they are not. Sent them a couple of emails.
28/02/22, 2:42 pm - +91 75690 61914: tried calling them ?
28/02/22, 2:53 pm - +91 73825 54571: Whatever be the issue
Lets think positive, even  if there lies any issue hope that gets solved and they get back to us.
Positive things happens to us
28/02/22, 3:01 pm - +65 8337 3637: No gave them the weekends respite. Will call them shortly today..
28/02/22, 3:07 pm - +91 88844 76831: Just needed one suggestion , the third course itself seems to me quite vast, i am still struggling to understand most of the concepts, viewing the videos quite a few times, how are you all planning to revise the entire course for the semester end exams?
28/02/22, 4:30 pm - +91 73825 54571: <Media omitted>
28/02/22, 4:36 pm - +91 79806 28509: If many of us still mail them to extend the dates with valid reasons then hopefully they would consider
28/02/22, 4:37 pm - +91 79806 28509: Which date you have requested?
28/02/22, 4:38 pm - +91 90071 50601: Yeah, i guess, we can do that.
28/02/22, 4:38 pm - +91 73825 54571: March month end or april first week
28/02/22, 4:38 pm - +91 79806 28509: Same for many of us, just attend mock test, revise , post doubts here..
28/02/22, 4:38 pm - +91 73825 54571: Do that
28/02/22, 5:09 pm - +91 98209 18938: I have also not completed course 3 .. still struggling..and forgetting concepts.. pls guide someone

28/02/22, 5:37 pm - +91 79806 28509: One basic question, 
whats the use of loss function & cost function, are they same or different?
28/02/22, 5:38 pm - +91 94529 09216: They are same
28/02/22, 5:46 pm - +91 79806 28509: seems like loss/error function is for a single data point & cost function is for entire data set, but in general terms are are used synonymously, here is one detailed explanation-

28/02/22, 5:50 pm - +91 96433 93292: Extend the date for mid term or semester exam ??
28/02/22, 5:58 pm - +91 78428 89792: You will get proper marks sheet after after the first semester itself

02/03/22, 10:54 am - +91 83300 49953: Guys, I have a doubt in time based splitting. If we don't split data based on time, some new data points will go into our training dataset instead of testing data set, and our model will get trained on this new data. What is the problem with this? üòÖ
02/03/22, 10:55 am - +91 73825 54571: Test should be done with unseen data
02/03/22, 10:59 am - +91 73825 54571: Time based should be done..
We have to return certain accuracy to our model.
That is the process
02/03/22, 11:07 am - +91 96505 18893: If you do not split it with time then u might be able to perform well with test data but your model will not perform well in the outside world.
02/03/22, 11:08 am - +91 73825 54571: Yes
02/03/22, 11:09 am - +91 96505 18893: Like what sir said mostly time based data splitting is done on internet company where data changes a lot with time and there it is crucial that we split our data with keeping time in mind so that our testing data is close to what the real data will be.
02/03/22, 11:09 am - +91 96505 18893: Hence we will get the real picture
02/03/22, 11:10 am - +91 83300 49953: Ohh okay. Understood now. Thank youüòÅ

Okay 
Thanks
02/03/22, 5:19 pm - +91 88640 27876: Any idea for those waiting for sem deferment
02/03/22, 5:20 pm - +91 90694 90675: I asked them about it if such student have to pay or not. No reply yet
02/03/22, 5:21 pm - +91 82983 18686: <Media omitted>
02/03/22, 5:23 pm - +91 88640 27876: I asked them
02/03/22, 5:23 pm - +91 88640 27876: They told to wait before 7
02/03/22, 5:23 pm - +91 88640 27876: *till 7
02/03/22, 5:34 pm - +65 8337 3637: I asked them about it
They said they are in talks with Uni on the terms. What they told us earlier about 2 year validity MAY no longer be valid. 
They said to be prepared for the exam whatsoever. They will inform us shortly.

The message was they are not offering students option to opt to continue studies with the next batch
02/03/22, 5:38 pm - +91 99721 79093: So much unwanted confusion and unnecessary rules
02/03/22, 5:40 pm - +91 99721 79093: They could have easily given us life time access like udemy or edx
02/03/22, 5:40 pm - +91 88003 13691: I sent a mail some time before to the Applied Roots asking for the same and they told me that we have the validity for 2 years. And exam missed , will be allowed to give next year . No need to repeat entire semester just the course you left.
02/03/22, 5:41 pm - +91 94959 66059: ü§£
02/03/22, 5:43 pm - +91 99721 79093: I am serious dude, you never know when you might refer to a topic...
I don't get the point of ONLY 2 YEARS VALIDITY.
is it fast food or what to have a shelf life...
02/03/22, 5:45 pm - +65 8337 3637: I had the same understanding. But I spoke to them not two days back. And now this is what it is...
02/03/22, 5:45 pm - +65 8337 3637: <Media omitted>
02/03/22, 5:47 pm - +65 8337 3637: üíØ
02/03/22, 5:56 pm - +91 88003 13691: Let's ask them for final confirmation. Because it will be very difficult for people who were thinking  that course would have two year validity.
02/03/22, 5:57 pm - +91 88640 27876: University of hyderabad realised that this is not diploma course
02/03/22, 5:57 pm - +91 88640 27876: This is Phd in AIML
02/03/22, 5:58 pm - +91 88003 13691: So they pulled the plug!
02/03/22, 5:58 pm - +91 88640 27876: For working professional(non cs) it may take 2 years
02/03/22, 5:58 pm - +91 88003 13691: Exactly
02/03/22, 5:58 pm - +65 8337 3637: Drop them a note. See what they say
They asked me to wait for confirmation on the same..
I, for sure, want some sort of deferment. 
I am not here to scrape through the course material to get those 40% marks
02/03/22, 5:59 pm - +91 88003 13691: Exactly
I've already dropped the mail.
02/03/22, 5:59 pm - +91 88640 27876: Yes man
02/03/22, 5:59 pm - +91 88003 13691: I haven't paid the fees yet.
02/03/22, 5:59 pm - +91 88640 27876: I asked them
02/03/22, 6:00 pm - +91 88640 27876: It seems University realised that why too many students are opting for deferment
02/03/22, 6:00 pm - +91 88003 13691: But it's due to the course na , you can't expect everyone to complete in the same duration.
02/03/22, 6:01 pm - +91 91647 37365: Is semester end  exam for 3 hours?
02/03/22, 6:01 pm - +91 88640 27876: Even from 1st batch I hope around 200 studentz opting
02/03/22, 6:01 pm - +65 8337 3637: Precisely
02/03/22, 6:02 pm - +91 83300 49953: Does this mean this is no longer a diploma? 
What are "alternate options"
02/03/22, 6:02 pm - +91 88640 27876: Yes I think so
02/03/22, 6:02 pm - +91 88640 27876: The course content seems too much as per UGC guidelines
02/03/22, 6:02 pm - +65 8337 3637: Not sure, on the call they said. They will ask the student for an immediate re-appearing of the exam üòÖüòÖ
02/03/22, 6:03 pm - +91 88640 27876: They may convert to applied Ai course students
02/03/22, 6:03 pm - +65 8337 3637: Hmm.. possible
02/03/22, 6:24 pm - +91 95582 32982: Hey what is the last date for the second term fees payment
02/03/22, 6:25 pm - +91 95582 32982: 3rd March or 8th March?
02/03/22, 6:29 pm - +91 78935 18350: 8th it is
02/03/22, 6:30 pm - +91 95582 32982: Did they send mail regarding that
02/03/22, 6:33 pm - +91 99451 11649: How does it makes difference for 5 days. üòÄ
02/03/22, 6:34 pm - +91 94959 66059: Credit card bill generation date bro üòé
02/03/22, 6:36 pm - +91 99451 11649: Okay..i assume for most of the banks it is month end. Makes sense
02/03/22, 6:50 pm - +91 95668 19500: True
02/03/22, 6:52 pm - +91 95582 32982: +1
02/03/22, 6:52 pm - +91 88003 13691: <Media omitted>
02/03/22, 6:53 pm - +91 89715 68712: Alternate options that can be offered? Options on what?
02/03/22, 6:54 pm - +91 88003 13691: I don't know , they should not change the rules mid way..
02/03/22, 6:54 pm - +91 78935 18350: For students who want to discontinue in this current batch
02/03/22, 6:55 pm - +91 89715 68712: Oh ok
02/03/22, 6:55 pm - +91 95610 76941: +1
02/03/22, 6:56 pm - +91 92932 48008: Yeah, they told me to wait for official announcement
Now I am in a diloma too
02/03/22, 7:04 pm - +91 78935 18350: Guys, course validity is for 2 years because that's the Max time offered by University of Hyderabad for this Diploma program. Why 2 years is because majority of the students are working employees and unfortunately if we failed any subject we will have second chance. There might be many requests from students regarding discontinuing this program. It's actually not an encouraging sign from administration perspective. So,that's why they are in discussion with UOH regarding alternate options. Discontinuing course at this point of time seems to be not a good idea, unless there is a strong reason not to pursue further. I suggest whoever having this idea, think once again. Give all exams and do well in thesis project next semester and definitely that will help u alot in interviews. Most of the companies (even applied roots) don't care about distinction percentage if you have strong portfolio. So try to build that portfolio. If you lost interest in ML, they u can definitely discontinue as everyone's time is so valuable
02/03/22, 7:05 pm - +91 95668 19500: üëç
02/03/22, 7:06 pm - +65 8337 3637: This is the understanding that I had as well..
02/03/22, 7:11 pm - +91 73550 42451: I think it is better to request to conduct a live session on Academic & Administrative  Discussion on 7th March by Srikhant sir and Satish sir after the mid sem exam and before the  last day of payment date i.e 8th March. What is you people thought on this?
02/03/22, 7:12 pm - +91 78935 18350: Ya, a live session helps everyone
02/03/22, 7:16 pm - +91 77760 81697: Is the sem-2 fee payment date extended ?
02/03/22, 7:19 pm - +91 78935 18350: There's is no official mail which has sent to everyone. But whoever asked them, they responded with "yes it's extended till March 8th."
02/03/22, 7:19 pm - +91 83449 80933: Just a random thought : Might be some of the students depend their career  on this course as last option. Even they tried hard to get knowledge as some were new to the field it's hard to clear crystal in concept wise . For those like candidates just a spark is more than enough . If they get placed in very small companies in this domain it would be more helpful. Then I think drop out percentage won't get reduced much. And all of us can be safe to sail the ship üö¢ and even the applied Roots administration
02/03/22, 7:32 pm - +91 88640 27876: But 38k is a big amount
02/03/22, 7:33 pm - +91 88640 27876: If you invest 78k in mutual fund
02/03/22, 7:33 pm - +91 88640 27876: <Media omitted>
02/03/22, 7:33 pm - +91 88640 27876: In 30 year it will become at least 51 lakh
02/03/22, 7:35 pm - +91 99451 11649: Who will give 15% and u have to see time value of money..u may not get more than 4% abs
02/03/22, 7:37 pm - +91 88640 27876: Index fund
02/03/22, 7:37 pm - +91 99721 79093: Upon this add the taxes of 15-20% and the mutual fund comission
02/03/22, 7:37 pm - +91 88640 27876: Check any index fund like nifty aur smallcap they will give around 18% CAGR
02/03/22, 7:38 pm - +91 99721 79093: They have an exit load
02/03/22, 7:38 pm - +91 88640 27876: LTCG is capped at max 15%
02/03/22, 7:38 pm - +91 88640 27876: Exit load is only for 1 years
02/03/22, 7:38 pm - +91 88640 27876: After that there is no Exit load
02/03/22, 7:39 pm - +91 88640 27876: U need to check again, most of the index fund have given more than 18% in last 20 years
02/03/22, 7:40 pm - +91 99721 79093: Exactly that's last 20 years
02/03/22, 7:42 pm - +91 99721 79093: Index are much save than mutual I agree, but no one can guarantee 15% per annual returns for next 20 years
02/03/22, 7:42 pm - +91 99451 11649: oh okay...what is value of Rs100 20 years back and now
02/03/22, 7:44 pm - +91 88640 27876: 100 rupees then is 400 worth now
02/03/22, 7:45 pm - +91 88640 27876: <Media omitted>
02/03/22, 7:45 pm - +91 99451 11649: 20% returns vs 400% value
02/03/22, 7:45 pm - +91 88640 27876: Man that is 20% CAGR
02/03/22, 7:46 pm - +91 88640 27876: <Media omitted>
02/03/22, 7:46 pm - +91 84476 21501: I think the point is not abt money,course is still good and applied ai team is also doing well.Only concern is time and the issue with working profession.Anyway its depend on ones individual thought but as per as learning point  of view, course is still good and should continue
02/03/22, 7:46 pm - +91 88640 27876: Nifty has grown from 1000 to 16000 in 20 yeas
02/03/22, 7:48 pm - +91 88640 27876: I agree man
02/03/22, 7:48 pm - +91 88640 27876: 100%
02/03/22, 7:49 pm - +91 99451 11649: agree..we are deviating from what is required for us
02/03/22, 7:52 pm - +91 84476 21501: Yaar ye 3rd term ka theory part hi finish nhi ho rha ..preperation kaise karein
02/03/22, 7:58 pm - +91 73550 42451: one thing you can do ... don't push yourself to understand thoroughly each concept & math behind that try to understand basic concept behind that ..also try to give mock test that will help you to understand level of questions..this method may be help you
02/03/22, 8:01 pm - +91 84476 21501: Thanks brother,theory part actually interesting so once i start i prefer to go through all theory,but this time its so much so have to skip some portion. And yes mock test is a good idea..i would go for mock test üôèüèª
02/03/22, 8:10 pm - +91 70090 20949: Guys I'm not able to understand, is the course discontinuing or just two year extension?
02/03/22, 8:13 pm - +91 88640 27876: Most probably it will be discontinued , this is our last batch
02/03/22, 8:14 pm - +91 70090 20949: Ok but we will be getting our diplomas right?
02/03/22, 8:14 pm - +91 88640 27876: Only you
02/03/22, 8:14 pm - +91 88640 27876: If you have Attended all exams so far

02/03/22, 8:20 pm - +91 88640 27876: After getting CONFIRMATION from applied root  team
02/03/22, 8:20 pm - +91 88640 27876: I will go

02/03/22, 8:35 pm - +91 98209 18938: I m confused now
02/03/22, 8:36 pm - +91 98209 18938: Are we in wrong boat ?
02/03/22, 8:39 pm - +91 73825 54571: What  made u think so
02/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 98209 18938: From all discussions above
02/03/22, 8:41 pm - +91 88640 27876: It seems most of them are frustrated, I thought only I am depressed

02/03/22, 8:42 pm - +91 95813 23427: all of these are assumptions, if they communicate like earlier. Everything will be back to normal
02/03/22, 8:44 pm - +91 89783 80243: If we didn't belive on anything.we can't able to move forward.Before quitting anything think about why you have started?.

If we stuck on anything, mentors and our fellow batchmates are helping.
02/03/22, 8:46 pm - +91 73825 54571: If u complete 30 % we can pass i guess....only speculation.notnsure
02/03/22, 8:47 pm - +91 95813 23427: yes
02/03/22, 8:47 pm - +91 95813 23427: use mock aswell
02/03/22, 8:52 pm - +91 88640 27876: Correct man

03/03/22, 8:35 am - +91 78935 18350: Applied AI acquired by Scaler Academy!
03/03/22, 8:36 am - +91 77748 96465: Idk if it's good news or bad
03/03/22, 8:36 am - +91 72648 49874: https://youtu.be/4ecVl5nPtVs
03/03/22, 8:37 am - +91 79806 28509: Yeah ,thats why live sessions were not there on weekends
03/03/22, 8:37 am - +91 72648 49874: This may be the reason of a week long silence
03/03/22, 8:37 am - +91 78935 18350: <Media omitted>
03/03/22, 8:37 am - +91 72648 49874: Now they're planning to have live sessions with industry experts from coming courses

03/03/22, 8:40 am - +91 72648 49874: I have seen the scaler program myself. It ia awesome. I would say that this is a great move.
03/03/22, 8:41 am - +91 94373 11224: yes
03/03/22, 8:41 am - +91 77748 96465: Thank god...we are existing students...scalar is super expensive
03/03/22, 8:41 am - +91 94373 11224: scaler is also nice as this one.
03/03/22, 8:41 am - +91 88640 27876: Everything is business
03/03/22, 8:41 am - +91 79806 28509: <Media omitted>
03/03/22, 8:41 am - +91 99123 54928: so if we postpone the semester, our diploma will be available or will they ask us to pay scalar fees?
03/03/22, 8:42 am - +65 8337 3637: Yes. Also they are instructor led courses which is good as well.
03/03/22, 8:42 am - +91 84476 21501: Agree
03/03/22, 8:42 am - +91 72648 49874: That'd not happen
03/03/22, 8:42 am - +91 84476 21501: But that would be not for existing student
03/03/22, 8:42 am - +91 72648 49874: Existing batches remain the same
03/03/22, 8:43 am - +91 97110 42979: They are not so much dedicated towards going on  batch .....as we are not getting weekly session during ML  as much like in starting
03/03/22, 8:43 am - +65 8337 3637: Video me 2nd innings ki baat kar rahe.. 
Unki to toh second, apan ko 12th man na bana de
03/03/22, 8:44 am - +91 75690 61914: What all are extra benefits which scalar provides than appliedroots ?
03/03/22, 8:44 am - +91 99123 54928: premium and costly lms
03/03/22, 8:45 am - +65 8337 3637: Also didn't see diploma in the new courses ( from what I saw in the vid)
So for all we know,
We might be the last batch
03/03/22, 8:45 am - +91 72648 49874: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
03/03/22, 8:45 am - +91 75690 61914: Yes
03/03/22, 8:45 am - +91 95120 95050: So their partnership with UoH is till second batch only.No more diploma program with UoH
03/03/22, 8:45 am - +91 84476 21501: Yes its last batch
03/03/22, 8:45 am - +91 72648 49874: And live classes. I van share one video with you and you'd get the quality üòé
03/03/22, 8:46 am - +91 75690 61914: When premium increases ofcourse LMS will, I want to know interms of assignment driven approach or theory driven approach or some other thing
03/03/22, 8:47 am - +91 88640 27876: I had told this yesterday
03/03/22, 8:47 am - +91 88640 27876: Or ye likith kon hai jo mere ko depressed bol rha tha
03/03/22, 8:48 am - +91 79806 28509: Its a race for biggest edtech in AI ML, just like unacademy bought every guy, same way scalar is doing in AI ML
03/03/22, 8:48 am - +91 99451 11649: this is the trend, once it is in good books. people make money
03/03/22, 8:49 am - +91 79806 28509: But i enrolled as i was under impression that money is never a priority for srikanth sur
03/03/22, 8:51 am - +91 84476 21501: This message was deleted
03/03/22, 8:51 am - +91 75690 61914: Ofcourse that would be the intention for every person who starts their ed-tech startup
03/03/22, 8:52 am - +91 75690 61914: And there is more dependency on srikanth sir, as he is only the one instructor for applied roots ML/DS. Very recently they are using new instructors for applied coding track n other courses
03/03/22, 8:53 am - +91 72648 49874: They jave tons of quizzes and hands on exercises as well as far as I have seen in both of their programs. They only have 2 programs, one for software development and one for data science
03/03/22, 8:53 am - +91 79806 28509: Or might be srikanth sir, influenced by shark tank , approached scaler to raise funds, but the scaler guys bought 100% equity
03/03/22, 8:53 am - +91 89727 71985: Scaler data science course is 2.5L + GST ü§Ø
03/03/22, 8:53 am - +91 99123 54928: Two major queries need to get confirmation from applied roots team:
1.if we postpone the semester exams now, till how many years we can do that and how many years we can get lms access. 
2.placements and live sessions will be conducted as usual or there will be any changes.
03/03/22, 8:53 am - +91 83418 08163: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
03/03/22, 8:53 am - +91 84476 21501: üòÄüòÄ
03/03/22, 8:55 am - +91 99451 11649: will start one more similar kind of thingüòÄ
03/03/22, 8:56 am - +91 70734 10928: Then I think we can ask in YouTube comments section that will this diploma degree be valid or not in this case, and what about placements, will be getting or not ? I think if we will all do this, they will surely conduct a live session for all the diploma students because nothing is changed except Diploma. This is not there in the new courses with scaler.
What you all think..
03/03/22, 8:56 am - +91 77748 96465: Guys ... Those who are thinking of not answering exams... please give it another thought... we don't know if there will b another batch or not....I think it will be risky move
03/03/22, 8:56 am - +91 77748 96465: And we should get in touch with team if there will be any effect on our placements and live sessions in sem 2
03/03/22, 8:57 am - +91 84476 21501: Yes agree,as there will be no new batches
03/03/22, 8:57 am - +91 70734 10928: Because our ultimate goal is palcements
03/03/22, 8:58 am - +91 78935 18350: If your startup want to be a successful, you have to generate revenue. You have to pay people in ur start-up competitively on par with other startups or else they will leave. So merging with Scalar is not a bad idea. But one concern is Ravindra Babu Ravula sir merged with Unacademy, after that he seemed like he's lost. He isn't displaying the same enthusiasm as earlier. Hope this Applied AI Team won't lose the interest later point.
03/03/22, 8:59 am - +91 77748 96465: Let's hope our batch can finish the diploma successfully as we had expected...
I'm not very excited about this merging of appliedAi with scalar
03/03/22, 8:59 am - +91 73825 54571: great thought
03/03/22, 8:59 am - +91 79806 28509: Yeah, so srikanth sir could have easily sell few % of equity to raise salary for employees for next 1 year
03/03/22, 9:00 am - +91 85005 93958: https://m.economictimes.com/tech/startups/ed-tech-firm-scaler-acquires-online-learning-platform-appliedroots-for-50-million/articleshow/89955175.cms
03/03/22, 9:00 am - +91 75690 61914: Yes even I felt the same interms of ravindra Babu ravula sir. Even I got feedback saying quality of his content is reduced.
03/03/22, 9:00 am - +91 99451 11649: I think it is some kind of risk, we dont know how support from HCU in future
03/03/22, 9:01 am - +91 72596 94754: can we mail them to ask about diploma continuation
03/03/22, 9:02 am - +91 77748 96465: Better still we can request for live session next week...we have to clear lots of doubts regarding this announcement
03/03/22, 9:02 am - +91 84476 21501: Ahh now its all about money
03/03/22, 9:02 am - +91 72596 94754: yes that is true
03/03/22, 9:03 am - +91 84476 21501: I think now they would not pay much attention to diploma students
03/03/22, 9:03 am - +91 84476 21501: Now only formalities
03/03/22, 9:04 am - +91 77748 96465: I can bet upcoming courses will be expensive
03/03/22, 9:04 am - +91 75690 61914: I believe keeping this acquisition in mind, they have asked us to pay fees of Term-2 before sem-1 is completed.
03/03/22, 9:04 am - +91 84476 21501: Yes now it would be from scalar,they are charging much for their courses
03/03/22, 9:04 am - +91 99165 48094: Yeah no further batches also right, they have to just keep this one going as it has already enrollments.
03/03/22, 9:04 am - +91 75690 61914: <Media omitted>
03/03/22, 9:04 am - +91 84476 21501: Exactly
03/03/22, 9:05 am - +91 72596 94754: oh okay
03/03/22, 9:06 am - +91 77748 96465: Since scalar will be calling all shots now....appliedAI won't have any say in prices of courses...
And there is slim hope that scalar will give affordable courses
03/03/22, 9:07 am - +91 79806 28509: Yeah so few applied roots students buy the course of 25k even after end course duration as they found content is lit more than the price value, now price would raise to lacs rupees
03/03/22, 9:07 am - +91 89727 71985: Forget it - scaler will increase the prices now
03/03/22, 9:07 am - +91 99165 48094: Also not sure how valuable this diploma would be. As it is no longer continued.
03/03/22, 9:07 am - +91 79806 28509: Scalar will recover 50 million from us
03/03/22, 9:07 am - +91 72596 94754: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/ed-tech-firm-scaler-acquires-online-learning-platform-appliedroots-for-50-million/articleshow/89955175.cms?from=mdr
03/03/22, 9:09 am - +91 77748 96465: 50million is just investment...
They want profits from it... not just recover their investment
03/03/22, 9:09 am - +91 89727 71985: So this diploma will be same as Applied AI course
03/03/22, 9:10 am - +91 78935 18350: Applied Roots team co-founders left their jobs in top FAANG companies and started Data science course for 25,000 rupees where everybody is charging minimum of 2 lakhs. They ran the same way for 5 years. Many new students are enrolling and they need to expand thier business to support thier student strength. They deserve this aquisition in my opinion but it will no longer be affordable education. That's the sad part!
03/03/22, 9:13 am - +91 79806 28509: Ok, but its our fate that it has heppened just middle of our diploma program, not 6 months before, not 6 months  later
03/03/22, 9:14 am - +91 97912 22474: Yeah
03/03/22, 9:15 am - +91 88988 90243: https://youtu.be/4ecVl5nPtVs
03/03/22, 9:21 am - +91 79806 28509: When he say to support projects being done in data science & ML team, whom he is pointing?
03/03/22, 9:24 am - +91 89727 71985: Hi Team,

Keeping in mind all the latest changes in Applied Roots, 
can we've a live session for all the questions and doubts to be answered in this or next week?
03/03/22, 9:24 am - +91 89727 71985: Everyone please send this mail
03/03/22, 9:25 am - +91 84476 21501: üëç
03/03/22, 9:26 am - +91 91762 75222: Not next week this Saturday
03/03/22, 9:26 am - +91 91762 75222: It'll be better
03/03/22, 9:26 am - +91 83300 49953: Bro this Sunday is our exam
03/03/22, 9:27 am - +91 91762 75222: Every Sunday is our exam
03/03/22, 9:27 am - +91 83300 49953: Ohh rightüòÇ
03/03/22, 9:28 am - +91 98209 18938: Not good news at all
03/03/22, 9:28 am - +91 73550 42451: or keep it Monday late evening 8pm  to 9:30 pm
03/03/22, 9:28 am - +91 98209 18938: Every one here paid the 2nd term fee ?
03/03/22, 9:28 am - +91 73550 42451: no
03/03/22, 9:28 am - +91 73550 42451: I am not
03/03/22, 9:28 am - +91 72648 49874: No
03/03/22, 9:29 am - +91 99165 48094: Not yet
03/03/22, 9:29 am - +91 98209 18938: Anyone here want to drop ?
03/03/22, 9:29 am - +91 73825 54571: Some paid
03/03/22, 9:29 am - +91 98209 18938: You planning to drop?
03/03/22, 9:29 am - +91 84476 21501: Not yet
03/03/22, 9:30 am - +91 98209 18938: All here planning to continue or drop ?
03/03/22, 9:32 am - +91 73550 42451: I don't think dropping is good idea, if they are merging with better platform and we can get their benefit also with Applied roots fee which is lesser in comparison to scaler
03/03/22, 9:32 am - +91 99165 48094: Since ours is an ongoing batch, they should give an option to convert into scaler program right, as we are also paying around 80k.
03/03/22, 9:32 am - +91 79806 28509: Why, sir said in video everything thing will remain same for the already enrolled student
03/03/22, 9:32 am - +91 88886 52319: +1
03/03/22, 9:33 am - +91 70090 20949: For existing students everything remains the same, no need to take stress unnecessarily and continue with the course
03/03/22, 9:33 am - +91 88886 52319: Now I am being more sceptical about job assistance üßê

Will they focus on us ?
03/03/22, 9:35 am - +91 75690 61914: Everything will remain same. As promised they will do the job assistance too. No need to worry about that
03/03/22, 9:35 am - +91 99451 11649: <Media omitted>
03/03/22, 9:36 am - +91 73825 54571: People like is gone fr appliedroots and in middle how can they convert our programme,they can change their decision but not ours.but still we get more mentors,more faculty,more placement opportunity with scaler
03/03/22, 9:36 am - +91 88845 57276: And pay more money also
03/03/22, 9:36 am - +91 73670 19974: Date for payment is extended no??
03/03/22, 9:37 am - +91 70090 20949: Existing students don't have to pay anything extra
03/03/22, 9:37 am - +91 78935 18350: Till March 8th
03/03/22, 9:37 am - +91 73670 19974: Ok
03/03/22, 9:37 am - +91 73670 19974: Can we pay through Google pay or phone pay??
03/03/22, 9:37 am - +91 79806 28509: Anyone get this? Pls suggest
03/03/22, 9:38 am - +91 73969 82848: Yes, it can be done
03/03/22, 9:38 am - +91 73670 19974: Ok
03/03/22, 9:38 am - +91 73670 19974: Thankuu
03/03/22, 9:39 am - +91 78935 18350: He is pointing to Scaler academy Data science and ML Team
03/03/22, 9:39 am - +91 73969 82848: This or Saturday morning would also be a good idea
03/03/22, 9:40 am - +91 99165 48094: Now here we are not able to go for a sem deferment also right... Atleast conversion will upgrade everything.
03/03/22, 9:40 am - +91 73969 82848: Not yet but i think most of us will
03/03/22, 9:40 am - +91 79806 28509: üòÑüòÑ and who'll support applied AI, he has stopped taking live sessions
03/03/22, 9:41 am - +91 78935 18350: They are merging with Scaler Data science and ML Team. There is no Applied AI course from March 10th. It will be just Scaler Data science and ML Program
03/03/22, 9:43 am - +91 88640 27876: <Media omitted>
03/03/22, 9:45 am - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Where do you the details of the new courses?
03/03/22, 9:45 am - Abhinaya Uoh Project: This message was deleted
03/03/22, 9:45 am - Abhinaya Uoh Project: This message was deleted
03/03/22, 9:45 am - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Find
03/03/22, 9:46 am - +91 73825 54571: Shall we ask for hardcopied of notes for next sem
03/03/22, 9:46 am - +91 73969 82848: Well said, they are in a way filling the gap for people looking to trasnsition which cannot be denied
03/03/22, 9:47 am - +91 73550 42451: yes
03/03/22, 9:47 am - +91 99451 11649: whether some one tried to call them,
03/03/22, 9:47 am - +91 99451 11649: just tried not picking up and sent a mail also.
03/03/22, 9:48 am - +91 79806 28509: Someone from scalar would get back
03/03/22, 9:49 am - +91 98209 18938: Now everything will be controlled by scalar... they may ask us more money in-between for sure.. else they will reduce some service for us ..
03/03/22, 9:50 am - +91 75690 61914: No no nothing will change for existing batch
03/03/22, 9:50 am - +91 75690 61914: It remains same
03/03/22, 9:51 am - +91 72648 49874: Exactly üëç
03/03/22, 9:51 am - +91 99451 11649: I suggest others also, to call them and check
03/03/22, 9:51 am - +91 99451 11649: speculation for long does not make sense
03/03/22, 9:52 am - +65 8337 3637: Afterall it was not Uni who was doubting/questioning on the Semester deferment then..
03/03/22, 9:52 am - +65 8337 3637: Just did, no response. Dropped them a note as well
03/03/22, 9:54 am - +91 73969 82848: All the terms would have already been negotiated and we can hope that Srikanth sir has kept our interests in mind
03/03/22, 9:54 am - +91 73969 82848: Lol
03/03/22, 9:54 am - +91 99451 11649: they have shown big thing finally
03/03/22, 9:55 am - +91 94373 11224: ü§üüòÇü§£
03/03/22, 9:55 am - +91 73825 54571: holidays?
03/03/22, 9:56 am - +91 98859 97600: There is no summer vacation üò≠
03/03/22, 9:56 am - +91 99451 11649: do we have exams as planned?
03/03/22, 9:56 am - +91 95603 55228: If anyone get response from applied root, please share here üôè
03/03/22, 9:56 am - +91 73825 54571: i want holidays
03/03/22, 9:57 am - +91 77748 96465: We should belive in Srikant sir...
Whatever happens after our batch we can't say...but sir will definately help us in our transition in data science
But we should get explaination on if things will be different than as already plan ..or if there will be some changes on how placements and live sessions will be conducted for us
03/03/22, 9:58 am - +91 73969 82848: Live interaction is the only way then üòÉüòÉ
03/03/22, 9:59 am - +91 77748 96465: Yes...from live session we can get better understanding of scenario...else there will be some or other doubts in everyone's mind
03/03/22, 10:01 am - +91 78935 18350: I am not sure who, but few people are trying really hard to panic themselves by thinking heavily. They also trying to create panic among others. Let's not forget that we have exams coming weekends and if we waste time on a topic which we are not clear about, it's hard to concentrate on studies. My suggestion is do not worry about anything unnecessarily. They will come back with answers for sure, till then relax and concentrate on revision üëç
03/03/22, 10:02 am - +91 73825 54571: time will answer everythiing
03/03/22, 10:04 am - +91 95603 55228: i agree with this also. keep patience till clear update...
03/03/22, 10:06 am - +91 95603 55228: we have last fees date 8th march who did not pay yet, so we can  just wait for next update from applied root.
03/03/22, 10:07 am - +91 97890 35993: Yet to pay‚úãüèΩ
03/03/22, 10:15 am - +91 88510 78354: Yet to pay

03/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 97018 27354: Scaler had 76 million USD in funding total and the bought AAIC for 50 million. Wow, looks like a Sequoia move/push.
03/03/22, 10:27 am - +91 99721 79093: Wow yaar
03/03/22, 10:28 am - +91 97018 27354: Scaler's income liquidity isn't that much. Mostly ISAs.
03/03/22, 10:28 am - +91 97890 35993: Ofcourse they will do, investing in education institute is good business
03/03/22, 10:28 am - +91 97018 27354: Varma sold cheap.
03/03/22, 10:29 am - +91 99721 79093: Actually
03/03/22, 10:29 am - +91 97890 35993: There course fees for ML is 2.5 lakhs
03/03/22, 10:30 am - +91 97018 27354: Will talk to my friends this weekend to know more, they work in Sequoia. Now I'm thinking of starting something. ü§î
03/03/22, 10:30 am - +91 99451 11649: is it...u have to see market share. lot of competition and easy to learn from home these days. it is very risky bet for scalar
03/03/22, 10:30 am - +91 97018 27354: Mostly ISAs.
03/03/22, 10:30 am - +91 99721 79093: It's would have been huge, if he invested more in the company. But you never know about the cashflow problems inside a company
03/03/22, 10:30 am - +91 88845 57276: There are so many new edtechs that have ventured in ML AI which is cheaper like ineuron, and students are opting for that as it is cheap in comparison to AAIC, so I guess this is a good deal
03/03/22, 10:31 am - +91 72045 68400: When is our exam date ? Please confirm
03/03/22, 10:31 am - +91 97018 27354: At some point everyone wants peace in life, hustle has an expiry date.
03/03/22, 10:32 am - +91 97018 27354: True. I don't know their burn rate, in some article from 2020 I read, 40 lakhs per month.
03/03/22, 10:33 am - +91 75690 61914: Its $50 million (USD) = 378 crores INR. I don't think that's cheap
03/03/22, 10:33 am - +91 97018 27354: By year end even I will be in market for sure. üòú
03/03/22, 10:33 am - +91 99451 11649: seems you are very tired with the course and saying vedantam
03/03/22, 10:35 am - +91 97018 27354: 100% acquisition. Taxes, 5-8 cofounders. You do the math.
03/03/22, 10:38 am - +91 99451 11649: 37.8 cr

03/03/22, 10:45 am - +91 89715 68712: But the course was on the university of Hyderabad tag, which ideally makes it eligible or approved by WES. That's one main reason, i joined the course. Now if they move to scalar, i doubt if it will be valid
03/03/22, 10:46 am - +91 70090 20949: Same here I joined for the same reason but I don't think anything will change fir existing students, UOH tag would still be there
03/03/22, 10:46 am - +91 89715 68712: I hope so.
03/03/22, 10:48 am - +91 99451 11649: yes ..just kidding
03/03/22, 10:49 am - +91 91762 75222: People started leaving this group
03/03/22, 10:49 am - +91 91762 75222: Let's start discussion about assignments, concepts
03/03/22, 10:49 am - +91 72045 68400: Exam dates please?
03/03/22, 10:50 am - +91 72045 68400: And time ?
03/03/22, 10:50 am - +91 72045 68400: TIA
03/03/22, 10:50 am - +91 91762 75222: Every Sunday of month march
03/03/22, 10:50 am - +91 72045 68400: Ok
03/03/22, 11:05 am - +91 80138 23518: Guys is today the last date for 2nd sem payment or any extention is there?
03/03/22, 11:10 am - +91 97411 84635: Few says extended till 8th march but not officially announced
03/03/22, 11:11 am - +91 85408 08934: It will 8 of march
03/03/22, 11:11 am - +91 70090 20949: It's better to pay it today itself no need to wait as for existing students course will continue to be the same
03/03/22, 11:12 am - +91 85408 08934: I had a call with the applied api team they will extend the date of 8 of march
03/03/22, 11:16 am - +91 97411 84635: Ok , great then üëç , but better to pay soon for people who want to continue,because of current situations. Hope they don‚Äôt change fees structure and support they provide
03/03/22, 11:17 am - +91 88845 57276: That can't happen
03/03/22, 11:17 am - +91 97411 84635: Umm yeah I also wish the same. üòÉ
03/03/22, 11:18 am - +91 88845 57276: Only thing is since this is the last batch, UoH won't be that excited about this course and also applied ai guys won't pay that much attention which we have seen in the recent times w.r.t live classes
03/03/22, 11:19 am - +91 80138 23518: However we will still receive course completion certificate from UoH only not Scalar so I guess term n conditions would n should remain the same otherwise it would amount to breach of contracts wd us

03/03/22, 11:23 am - +91 97411 84635: I payed my 2nd term fees , as I trust Srikanth sir, he is the man with honesty I feel , loosing money for knowledge and education is not really loosing I feel.
03/03/22, 11:25 am - +91 88886 52319: We will see that... Today education is a business !!
03/03/22, 11:26 am - +91 77760 81697: Recently I saw video on Youtube in which Shrikant sir announced that aaic collaborator with scalar
03/03/22, 11:29 am - +91 77760 81697: I think scalar acquired aaic
03/03/22, 11:31 am - +91 90071 50601: Late to the party I guess
03/03/22, 11:32 am - +91 89399 22582: Can we request the team to postpone the semester exams to next month, as I see most of are not ready/prepared to take exams

03/03/22, 11:33 am - +91 70877 58526: This is the only thing I am sad about. I feel like being in those terms where next batch will have new syllabus.
03/03/22, 11:34 am - +91 70877 58526: There was only one thing good about this ed tech era that good education was given at affordable prices, now i feel they are just replacing the universities.

03/03/22, 11:42 am - +91 95610 76941: I think they are not paying much attention lately. I can say this course too tough  for non-cs person like me.  I thought there will be live session/course but only pre-recorded videos is  here. There is no connection between videos. And surely not from scratch as stated in advertising. 

I am studying hard to understand concepts of ML. There is  no proper interaction between student and teacher. Studying each concept from YouTube and other platforms.

Feels like waste of money and time. 
Many of you are working in this domain and from cs background.
So,Some people might find this course helpful. 

Teaching skills of kanth sir are awesome but overall course is not upto the mark. 

Not spreading negatively guys but my genuine review as a student.
03/03/22, 11:43 am - +91 93464 10791: Try Krish Naik's iNeuron.

03/03/22, 11:43 am - +91 87587 85027: Well... Worrying won't answer anything clearly at this moment... We'll just have to wait for a live session on Q&A discussion with Srikant sir... Till then I think we should not worry (just keeping in mind)
03/03/22, 11:43 am - +91 93464 10791: He's offering so much for only 7-8k.
03/03/22, 11:43 am - +91 89210 23935: üò∂üò∂ I got one neuron, not impressed with their quality
03/03/22, 11:44 am - +91 89210 23935: Live sessions are too long. Information density in video is very less in my option

03/03/22, 11:44 am - +91 97018 27354: Let's focus on learning the material. And be good at it. No need for so much speculation regarding the fate of the program. With time we will know for sure. Today I'm happy with the material and this group.

03/03/22, 11:45 am - +91 87587 85027: And Acquisitions are messy and on limited resources they might not be able to output for few days... (Well I agree that they should tell us due to internal discussion they were suspended live sessions) but we'll see their view on this.

No doubt in that and Applied roots will support the LMS until then.

03/03/22, 12:03 pm - +91 97018 27354: Same boat bhai, I'm not prepared for 3rd course. Wing it kind of situation. Probably too late to postpone, if you are sending an email let me know, I'll send one.

03/03/22, 12:23 pm - +91 78935 55163: Though like applied root will grow like big giant, now it's got acquired, course was best suited for PPL having money constraints, but didn't expect this to happen

03/03/22, 12:27 pm - +91 97018 27354: Even 2 weeks would be sufficient, 3rd course. We can give course 1 n 2 as scheduled.
03/03/22, 12:57 pm - +91 97411 84635: Yes guys due to corona 3 wave we also lost around weeks due to corona , and recovery  we can try for 2 weeks
03/03/22, 1:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: Maybe a zoom session this week?
03/03/22, 1:06 pm - +91 96505 18893: But now not much time is left ‚Ä¶ may be we all can come up with some MCQs and share with each other more like creating some kind of question bank. Just a thought

03/03/22, 1:07 pm - +91 96505 18893: Yeah that is also a way
03/03/22, 1:08 pm - +91 96505 18893: That will be quick and more effective
03/03/22, 1:10 pm - +91 79806 28509: Yes ,please share MCQs, and lets discuss here

03/03/22, 1:20 pm - +91 96505 18893: See a tie-up with a university is always a good thing for ed-tech. University of Hyderabad is one of the good  universities in India. Y would scaler not want to continue this program? And before acquiring they must have talked to university about it. I do not think University will have any trouble until the content quality decline. Even if things do not work between them. It is not us who should be worried. We do not have appliedroots ID card we have UoH ID card. We pay our fees to UoH. So whatever appliedroot do is not our problem. Only thing which can impact is our placement assistance. But lets think positive and get best out of this program.
03/03/22, 1:22 pm - +91 81237 97950: Me.

03/03/22, 1:51 pm - +91 88510 78354: We can mail them to give us extra 1 week time to prepare for exams.
If most of us mail them, they will postpone the exams

03/03/22, 2:56 pm - +91 97018 27354: I don't think it will happen. UoH already has a MTech in AI program in place.
03/03/22, 2:57 pm - +91 77748 96465: With scalar taking charge of everything...it all depends on them
03/03/22, 2:58 pm - +91 77748 96465: Applied AI would have definately started MS program if this acquisition had not happend
03/03/22, 2:58 pm - +91 97018 27354: People looking for online MS should look at ASU masters in CS or UCBoulder masters in Data Science.
03/03/22, 2:59 pm - +91 97018 27354: Both on Coursera
03/03/22, 3:01 pm - +91 77748 96465: Anyone has idea about nanodegree from udacity?

03/03/22, 3:09 pm - +91 88640 27876: I called them now
03/03/22, 3:10 pm - +91 88640 27876: they told for those wo didn't write any exams
03/03/22, 3:10 pm - +91 88640 27876: separate exams will be conducted
03/03/22, 3:10 pm - +91 88640 27876: and course will be valid for next 18 months
03/03/22, 3:10 pm - +91 88640 27876: so no need to worry
03/03/22, 3:10 pm - +91 88640 27876: we all will get degree

03/03/22, 3:45 pm - +91 96544 29444: Like the content is one and the same in both of the programs
03/03/22, 3:45 pm - +91 96544 29444: Or there is major difference
03/03/22, 3:46 pm - +91 96544 29444: I am less concerned with the accreditation of UOH, but I need good material to study from.

03/03/22, 3:58 pm - +91 78935 18350: Content is almost same in both the courses. You won't be having data structures/oops concepts stuff in applied ai course. The assignments are bit hard in Applied AI course (all are coding heavy assignments unlike in diploma) and if you are able to solve all 30 assignments and 2 projects from applied ai, you can crack any top company. It is mandatory to solve all 30 assignments and 2 projects to sit for placements in general.
03/03/22, 4:00 pm - +91 96544 29444: Oh thank you so much this helps!
03/03/22, 4:08 pm - +91 99208 18609: Scaler acquired AAIC
03/03/22, 4:08 pm - +91 99208 18609: ?
03/03/22, 4:10 pm - +91 89210 23935: Why would you want to drop out and take applied ai course? Diploma has more validity, there are more content, query resolution is good, and you get accreditation, plus you are already at the end of first semester. The assignments are given as optional here, if they added it as mandatory as in case of applied ai course, working people would not be able to manage the course content. Diploma is a superset of all the content. Only difference is job guarantee. There are certain jobs postings which only people completed all assignments 30 assignment + 2 self case study + blogs can apply.
03/03/22, 4:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: You can see the job posting in applied roots classroom

03/03/22, 4:16 pm - +91 88640 27876: University of hyderabad

03/03/22, 4:21 pm - +91 88845 57276: That is for applied ai course
03/03/22, 4:22 pm - +91 88886 52319: It is not Diploma degree, it is Diploma Certificate programme.

To my knowledge, UGC wont allow any institute to grant diploma degree on the basis of private curriculam and online recorded videos.
03/03/22, 4:23 pm - +91 88988 90243: Diploma level
03/03/22, 4:23 pm - +91 70090 20949: Bro it's a ugc approved diploma course
03/03/22, 4:23 pm - +91 70090 20949: Degree is something different
03/03/22, 4:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: Why do you think it is a Diploma certificate program?
03/03/22, 4:24 pm - +91 80138 23518: So does it suddenly look like a good trade-off to drop out of this course n enroll for the applied AI course?? However with Scalar taking up Applied AI course might not be available at 25k at all
03/03/22, 4:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: It is UGC accredited. How will that change suddenly?

03/03/22, 4:33 pm - +91 80138 23518: So chill guys that one option for dropping out n enrolling for Applied AI course just went out of the window üòÜ
03/03/22, 4:34 pm - +91 89210 23935: It means the monetary value of our course increased. We are getting the benifits of joining early
03/03/22, 4:34 pm - +91 80138 23518: Here we should feel rather lucky that we enrolled timely for this course 6 month bk otherwise we would have been shocked by now

03/03/22, 4:37 pm - +91 97411 84635: do we need to code only final two statements right ?
03/03/22, 4:37 pm - +91 97411 84635: as they are the final gradients for lossand bias terms
03/03/22, 4:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes, it is the simplified form
03/03/22, 4:42 pm - +91 81237 97950: It is still under the window right , March 10?
03/03/22, 4:43 pm - +91 97411 84635: ok , got it thank you but one question , this loss function we are using is from the probabilistic interpretation right , and why are we using N (dividing by) in the L1 regularisation which is not specified in the course , is this because we are doing this for only value and L1 regularisation will be done entire N values , am i rght?
03/03/22, 4:57 pm - +91 80138 23518: Yes dts right then.... So 1 week to rethink..  does it mean fees for this course also can be paid by 10th March by any chance
03/03/22, 5:00 pm - +91 89210 23935: From a theoretical perspective, it should also work without N. Only lamda is impacted and changed. I don't know if there is any computational easiness reason.
03/03/22, 5:08 pm - +91 97411 84635: ok
03/03/22, 5:15 pm - +91 81237 97950: Have to be verified, did see March 8th was last date from the chats.

03/03/22, 7:03 pm - +91 97018 27354: But has many plus points like multiple faculty, and weekly problem solving sessions.
03/03/22, 7:07 pm - +91 97018 27354: Everything is and will be available for free on YouTube. Don't bother with too many courses. Stick to one and finish it, repeat everything by taking free university courses on YouTube. I personally find it helpful in my learning. And projects like @917264849874 suggested us to do kaggle.

04/03/22, 9:47 am - +91 79806 28509: Q. Ways to avoid overfitting

1. Cross-validation
2. Train with more data
2. Remove irrelevant features
3. Early stopping
4. L1/L2 Regularization
5. Minimize loss/errors
6. Remove layers / number of units per layer

Q.  Image classification algorithms
 A. Image Classification algorithms are the algorithms which are used to classify labels for images using their characteristics. Example: Convolutional Neural Networks

Q. How do you handle categorical data?

A. One-Hot Encoding is the most common, correct way to deal with non-ordinal categorical data. It consists of creating an additional feature for each group of the categorical feature and mark each observation belonging (Value=1) or not (Value=0) to that group.



Q.  What Is Interpolation And Extrapolation?

A. Interpolation is the process of calculating the unknown value from known given values whereas extrapolation is the process of calculating unknown values beyond the given data points.


Q.  How do you handle null values and which Imputation method is more favorable?

A. Ways to handle missing values in the dataset:

Deleting Rows with missing values.
Impute missing values for continuous variable.
Impute missing values for categorical variable.
Other Imputation Methods.
Using Algorithms that support missing values.
Prediction of missing values.
04/03/22, 9:50 am - +91 77748 96465: Can anyone explain in layman's term what is interpolation and extrapolation with examples?

04/03/22, 10:56 am - +91 72648 49874: Regression analysis can only be used for intrapolation
04/03/22, 10:56 am - +91 72648 49874: For extrapolation we'll need forecasting models or similar
04/03/22, 11:13 am - +91 72648 49874: https://youtu.be/NWNs5PLamzQ
04/03/22, 11:17 am - +91 79806 28509: Forecasting models means hyperplane equation/function can be different one  compared to the equation/model we  build by training data?
04/03/22, 11:18 am - +91 77748 96465: Thanks @917980628509  and @917264849874 üëçüèª
04/03/22, 11:19 am - +91 72648 49874: Not essentially. Forecasting means to simply mathematically replicate the behaviour found in past from patterns in training data. These patterns include trend, seasonality, cyclicity and noise. üëç
04/03/22, 11:20 am - +91 77748 96465: We will learn forecasting in next semester right?
04/03/22, 11:21 am - +91 80138 23518: Yeah Time Series

04/03/22, 11:25 am - +91 72648 49874: I don't know. AppliedAiCourse curriculum had time series but only w.r.t LSTM models. Ar oeast the courses did not cover the business relevance of forecasting. But we have a great book available online, hence I am not worried üòé
04/03/22, 11:25 am - +91 77748 96465: Which book?

04/03/22, 10:13 pm - +91 97018 27354: Guys, I think the diploma will be discontinued. UoH has removed the program from their website. Applied roots may be delaying the NEWS.

04/03/22, 10:17 pm - +91 97018 27354: When was this?
04/03/22, 10:17 pm - +91 77748 96465: .
04/03/22, 10:18 pm - +91 70090 20949: Yeah most probably it is getting discontinued and applied roots team has already confirmed my mail if anybody has asked, they are trying to negotiate but ours is the Last batch for now
04/03/22, 10:20 pm - +91 90357 92877: Something about us being the last batch, and them asking us to pay the fees asap feels shadyüòÇ
Hope they actually provide placement assistance at the end, a lot of people are waiting for it
04/03/22, 10:20 pm - +91 89399 22582: In such case, would certificate from UoH will be valid, as only 2 batches came out of this Diploma program, I mean would the UoH credentials would add weightage to our career
04/03/22, 10:20 pm - +91 88640 27876: Its there man check it again
04/03/22, 10:20 pm - +91 77748 96465: True .. 
But I feel they will do it as promised
04/03/22, 10:21 pm - +91 77748 96465: Not sure Abt credentials...but skills we will gain will definitely add weightage
04/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 88988 90243: Absolutely
04/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 97018 27354: There won't be any negotiations, since in Parliament education minister, passed some amendment regarding this. Universities can;t collaborate with pvt companies to give diplomas or degrees.
04/03/22, 10:24 pm - +91 97018 27354: check the 2022 one
04/03/22, 10:24 pm - +91 88640 27876: Yes its not there
04/03/22, 10:24 pm - +91 95610 76941: Right .
As stated by kanth sir , till clear instructions from government it's  certificate not diploma
04/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 88640 27876: I think those who had planned for deferrment are in big trouble
04/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 97018 27354: Our certificates will be valid.
04/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 97018 27354: 100%
04/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 97018 27354: 101%

04/03/22, 10:27 pm - +91 89399 22582: I feel we should request applied roots team to conduct a Q&A session with current batch students, to address our concern s
04/03/22, 10:28 pm - +91 88510 78354: I called them today
They confirmed that this batch is the last batch of diploma
04/03/22, 10:28 pm - +91 97018 27354: I'll call University of Hyderabad directly to get some information.
04/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 97018 27354: Now we need to call the University to check if at all we will get transcripts and diploma.
04/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 97018 27354: Not applied roots.
04/03/22, 10:31 pm - +91 97018 27354: Any one living in Gachibowli / Botanical Garden(Kondapur)?
04/03/22, 10:31 pm - +91 88640 27876: I called them, they told they will organise supplementary exams
04/03/22, 10:32 pm - +91 88510 78354: They said that we will definitely conduct exams before sept 2023.
04/03/22, 10:32 pm - +91 88510 78354: They are in talk with the universities
04/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 88510 78354: Did they tell you when??
04/03/22, 10:34 pm - +91 88640 27876: Yesterday
04/03/22, 10:34 pm - +91 97018 27354: 2022 or 2023

04/03/22, 10:38 pm - +91 98859 97600: Haha ü§£ I Posted in telegram by thinking the same .so that someone can explain me detailed
04/03/22, 10:39 pm - +91 77748 96465: üòÇüòÇ
Telegram group is not so active compare to WhatsApp group...so I forwarded it here
04/03/22, 10:44 pm - +91 72648 49874: consider the transformations done by SVM like a virtual dimension and not a change to the data. hence kernel trick simply is a trick to solve the classification/regression problem in hand in case of complicated data. did this help you understand?
04/03/22, 10:46 pm - +91 77748 96465: But in lecture sir told that...after using polynomial kernel on d dim data we get d' dim... where d'>d
And these d' dim help in feature transformation
04/03/22, 10:47 pm - +91 77748 96465: So isn't this same as point 1?
04/03/22, 10:47 pm - +91 77748 96465: I'm bit confused Abt this
04/03/22, 10:49 pm - +91 95004 40196: Yes. Also he added that, when the dimension increases Kernel SVM classifies better...
04/03/22, 10:52 pm - +91 99450 16190: Guys,
Since there is no next batch. For those who missed giving midterm exams in our batch, will there be midterm exam again for them? Any idea‚Ä¶
04/03/22, 10:52 pm - +91 72648 49874: Correct. But the increase in dimension is a trick. It is not a physical dimension which is getting added. That's the trick in the question as well üòé
04/03/22, 10:53 pm - +91 79806 28509: This is so confusing, what i know is svm dont actually transform data into high dimension, rather its just a trick to estimate what would be the representation if the points are in high dimension?
04/03/22, 10:53 pm - +91 72648 49874: Exactly üëç
04/03/22, 10:54 pm - +91 98859 97600: Common it's like again some hypothesis testing üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
04/03/22, 10:54 pm - +91 77748 96465: So then d'>d is not actually happening?

04/03/22, 10:55 pm - +91 79806 28509: Thx dada, but the explanation in the screenshot is betond understandingüòÑ

04/03/22, 11:04 pm - +91 79806 28509: Thanx, yes transforming & representing in high dim will be costlier & time consuming, so rather it just calculates the inner product which estimates the relationship between points in high dim
04/03/22, 11:06 pm - +91 72648 49874: i agree. that's what caused the confusion to many üòÄ
04/03/22, 11:06 pm - +1 (610) 505-1068: Anyone aware of data camp ? Any opinions ?
04/03/22, 11:14 pm - +91 72648 49874: For us confused with Kernels in SVM... let's go back to the Guru of AI and ML:

05/03/22, 9:42 am - +91 91762 75222: Why they have removed our old midterm exams data
05/03/22, 9:42 am - +91 91762 75222: ???
05/03/22, 9:42 am - +91 77748 96465: Just confirm with team...if u have not written mid term then u can answer term exam or not
05/03/22, 9:43 am - +91 91762 75222: Guys our mid term exam data is not available
05/03/22, 9:44 am - +91 88640 27876: And also I have not attempted any assignments but completed almost all videos, was planning to defer the semester

Or over all they calculate?

Anyone has clear idea?
05/03/22, 10:12 pm - +91 70956 76898: Yes... Search your mail box with "enrollment card"
05/03/22, 10:14 pm - +91 73825 54571: For multi-class : {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

Else:No
....
05/03/22, 10:14 pm - +91 99450 16190: There is no minimum required marks in Midterms‚Ä¶

05/03/22, 10:37 pm - +91 82371 27097: Even with the windows calc it was exhausting
05/03/22, 10:38 pm - +91 77748 96465: To do calculations...we need scientific calculator...to do it faster
05/03/22, 10:38 pm - +91 73825 54571: Who got above 25

05/03/22, 11:58 pm - +91 82371 27097: So you used colab for the numericals where weight vectors and some test data was given?
05/03/22, 11:59 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes
05/03/22, 11:59 pm - +91 98933 88933: Without colab it'll take forever

06/03/22, 12:05 am - +91 98933 88933: Oh yes you're right, that didn't click me
06/03/22, 12:06 am - +91 98933 88933: Ideally they should avoid corner cases esp. language related confusions
06/03/22, 12:06 am - +91 98933 88933: Better if they gave non negative in the options instead of positive
06/03/22, 12:06 am - +91 98933 88933: In the question*
06/03/22, 12:06 am - +91 70877 58526: Yea
06/03/22, 12:09 am - +91 98933 88933: @918851078354 The solution given to this question is a code which implies that we can use colab (because it was no where mentioned in this question that we can use colab)
06/03/22, 12:10 am - +91 98933 88933: Yes sir told this
06/03/22, 12:17 am - +91 98933 88933: In most of the questions given in mock, I felt that emphasis was given on whether we know how to apply a formula practically (through code)

Like in logloss case we all know logloss = -1/n sigma[yi*log(pi) + (1-yi)log(1-pi)]
Where pi=sigmoid(wT*xi)

But given w, x and y, can we find logloss using a piece of code, the thing that they want to test is can you implement:
- wT*xi programmatically
 - sigmoid function programmatically
- sigma ln(pi) programmatically
06/03/22, 12:19 am - +91 79806 28509: doesn't a lot of ask for just 1 markü•≤
06/03/22, 12:19 am - +91 98933 88933: Yes I too felt that thing
06/03/22, 12:20 am - +91 98933 88933: Marks of easy medium hard questions should not be the same
06/03/22, 12:20 am - +91 98933 88933: Otherwise what's the point

06/03/22, 2:31 am - +91 88510 78354: Both
06/03/22, 2:33 am - +91 88510 78354: But in some cases like cancer detection, FN should be extremely low
06/03/22, 5:54 am - +91 96505 18893: Can someone tell me is there any faster way to calculate the naive bayes based question? Do we need to find the probability for all the cases?

06/03/22, 7:00 am - +91 72181 64871: For calculation purpose you'd use the gate exam calculator which is available online.

06/03/22, 10:40 am - +91 96505 18893: In mock test there were few questions on them. So i guess give it read from the notes. Even I have not completed that just reading it from the notes.
06/03/22, 10:41 am - +91 96505 18893: Same here
06/03/22, 10:47 am - +91 91762 75222: Guys after this month let's all collaborate and ask AAIC to include our names in monthly tests...
My thought is to extract maximum from Applied roots, because we are the last applied roots students, after match 10 it becomes scaler
06/03/22, 10:48 am - +91 91762 75222: We can write single mail and write all the names who is interested to have monthly tests in that mail
06/03/22, 10:53 am - +91 98933 88933: In LSH, we put those points in the same bucket which have the same sign(wT*x) value, here we need to calculate sign(wT*x) for each xi and for both w1 and w2, whichever points get the same hash go in the same bucket

FYI,
sign(positive number) = +1
sign(negative number) = -1

For eg. w1=[2,2] w2=[1,-1]

w1T*x1 = 2*4+1*1 = 9
sign(w1T*x1) = +1

w2T*x1 = 1*4 - 1*1 = 3
sign(w2T*x1) = +1

Now for x1, the hashed value that we get is: (+1, +1)
Whichever points get the same hashed value (+1, +1) will go in the same bucket as x1, here it is x7

Similarly we've to compute the hashed value for all points and group them together
Is it clear now @919560355228 ?
(CC: @918898890243 )
06/03/22, 10:57 am - +91 77748 96465: What kind of test?
Like the ones we have for exam?
Or some coding ones?
06/03/22, 10:58 am - +91 91762 75222: Similar to interview
06/03/22, 10:58 am - +91 91762 75222: Aaic students have monthly exams
06/03/22, 10:58 am - +91 77748 96465: Haa...that would be helpful
06/03/22, 10:58 am - +91 91762 75222: Ya exactly

06/03/22, 11:31 am - +91 98933 88933: By wT*x, I meant the dot product of w and x (w1x1 + w2x2 + ...)
06/03/22, 11:31 am - +91 79806 28509: i had asked them to provide more MCQs practice question, as in 2nd mid term , there are 100 practice question for probablity, so if they can provide in the same way, they replied that you can practice & implement optional assignments , thats enoough to practice
06/03/22, 11:32 am - +91 98933 88933: By default we assume w and x to be column vectors hence wT*x will be a scalar
06/03/22, 11:36 am - +91 75690 61914: Did anyone got right solution for this problem? I'm getting 0.2 as answer

06/03/22, 11:42 am - +91 79806 28509: Can we use math, numpy, pandas, sklearn libraries?
06/03/22, 11:44 am - +91 79806 28509: in exam, as i see you used np.dot?
06/03/22, 11:48 am - +91 75690 61914: I guess we can use, unless it is not mentioned as not to use them.
06/03/22, 11:49 am - +91 75690 61914: Bcoz if we want to calculate manually, the logloss kind of problems itself will take 20-25min to solve
06/03/22, 12:00 pm - +91 98933 88933: I think using numpy pandas is ok but sklearn should not be used

06/03/22, 1:18 pm - +91 96184 80572: I sent a mail to them asking to conduct a live session
06/03/22, 1:18 pm - +91 96184 80572: They have replied with this video
06/03/22, 1:18 pm - +91 75690 61914: If they launch masters program and if they say that they will not transfer diploma credits to masters program, will ask Putin to drop a bomb on applied roots team üòÇüòÇ 

Srikanth sir told that as per ugc credits can be transferred.

06/03/22, 1:20 pm - +91 91762 75222: No we cant transfer credits because, if the masters program is not igc approved
06/03/22, 1:20 pm - +91 94959 66059: So looks like just for this video they have created a new channel? Surprising ‚Ä¶.
06/03/22, 1:20 pm - +91 96184 80572: A live session would‚Äôve been lot better where we could interact üòë
06/03/22, 1:21 pm - +91 94959 66059: It‚Äôs a completely new channel created yesterday only with only 1 subscribers (assuming that too must from from anyone of us)
06/03/22, 1:21 pm - +91 77748 96465: True . . There are lot of things that needs to be clarified
06/03/22, 1:21 pm - +91 75690 61914: Srikant sir assured this credits transfer in initial live sessions, if we refer to live sessions in essentials of AI, he clearly mentioned
06/03/22, 1:21 pm - +91 81445 54148: Will
06/03/22, 1:22 pm - +91 96184 80572: Exactly not sure why they have time for everything else and not for us..a 1 hour session at least would‚Äôve been assuring enough
06/03/22, 1:22 pm - +91 91762 75222: Yes they said that... But don't keep high hopes anything can change in future
06/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 96184 80572: <Media omitted>
06/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 96184 80572: This is meant for applied Ai students may be

06/03/22, 1:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah it's for applied ai, and maybe for batch 1 also.
06/03/22, 1:27 pm - +91 89210 23935: Well things are bit clear now üòÖ
06/03/22, 1:27 pm - +91 99998 58727: Has anyone mailed and asked how will we get access to the live sessions they have conducted on Airmeet for batch 1 or AI students

06/03/22, 1:33 pm - +91 78935 18350: Generally Sunday night sessions are meant for Applied AI students or Gate Students
06/03/22, 1:34 pm - +91 88640 27876: Something looks fishy to me
06/03/22, 1:35 pm - +91 72045 68400: Where is the exam link for today 7pm?

I don‚Äôt see it in tests section!

06/03/22, 1:38 pm - +91 84948 36428: Higher the value of CDF = more points below that point -> better the model 
i.e more the area under the point,better the model
06/03/22, 1:38 pm - +91 72045 68400: Any thoughts?
06/03/22, 1:39 pm - +91 89210 23935: It's similar to tpr vs fpr in auc that's why I had this intuition
06/03/22, 1:40 pm - +91 97912 22474: Ok
06/03/22, 1:40 pm - +91 97912 22474: Ok

06/03/22, 6:01 pm - +91 82371 27097: And GBDT cannot, as the base models are not parallelized as they are in Random Forest, right?

06/03/22, 6:02 pm - +91 77748 96465: Yes...in bagging we can take probability score from majority vote...while in gbdt we have sequential models
That's the reasoning I can think of
06/03/22, 6:03 pm - +91 88855 50259: GBDT cannot give probability scores not because it can't be parallelized. But because the final model is equivalent to a well trained decision tree.

06/03/22, 6:09 pm - +91 88855 50259: using PCA does not retain the variance (about 50% of the variance will be lost by doing PCA). You cannot arrive at 100% separation with just 4 splits
06/03/22, 6:09 pm - +91 89210 23935: Column standardization.

Mandatory for knn

Not mandatory but can help in faster convergence in case of logistic regression

Decision tree: standardization not recommended

Naive Bayes?? Do naive Bayes require standardization?
06/03/22, 6:10 pm - +91 95000 08014: NB does not require std
06/03/22, 6:11 pm - +91 88988 90243: not required in naive bayes
not disatcne based right?
06/03/22, 6:11 pm - +91 88988 90243: distance
06/03/22, 6:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think no standardization is required for NB.
06/03/22, 6:12 pm - +91 82371 27097: What question is this? Can you resend the question number
06/03/22, 6:14 pm - +91 91762 75222: I've edited the excel
06/03/22, 6:15 pm - +977 984-5864046: I didn't get any emails from AAIC
06/03/22, 6:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: <Media omitted>
06/03/22, 6:16 pm - +91 91762 75222: error = bias^2 + variance + irreducible error
06/03/22, 6:16 pm - +91 91762 75222: am I correct?
06/03/22, 6:16 pm - +91 88855 50259: yeah
06/03/22, 6:16 pm - +91 95603 55228: <Media omitted>
06/03/22, 6:17 pm - +91 88855 50259: Technically, it is called generalization error (because it is the error on unseen points)
06/03/22, 6:17 pm - +91 89210 23935: The new feature will only have +ve sides.
06/03/22, 6:17 pm - +91 82371 27097: Yes. And then the classes will be separable only with 1 plane
06/03/22, 6:18 pm - +91 82371 27097: That's why they've used the "slicing off the top of the pyramid" phrase
06/03/22, 6:18 pm - +91 73825 54571: <Media omitted>
06/03/22, 6:18 pm - +91 73825 54571: Like this

06/03/22, 6:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: Simply, the new feature will be sufficient to seperate the data points. Datapoints from all 4 quadrants will come to the +ve quadrant
06/03/22, 6:19 pm - +91 82371 27097: Nice explanation though. I remembered the interstellar explanation of wormholes using a sheet of paper
06/03/22, 6:25 pm - +91 96184 80572: Thank you
06/03/22, 6:27 pm - +91 89210 23935: It's not accurate, but the intuition is similar.
06/03/22, 6:37 pm - +91 83329 81498: The test link disappeared for me
06/03/22, 6:38 pm - +91 90071 50601: Hi, do you we need to start the exam by 7 or can we start around 7:30?
06/03/22, 6:40 pm - +91 88855 50259: Test is 90 mins from 7 to 8:30. If you are late you lose time.

06/03/22, 6:44 pm - +91 81445 54148: one doubt KNN - is low bias , high variance model right
06/03/22, 6:44 pm - +91 81445 54148: KNN, DECISION Tree , Random forest
06/03/22, 6:45 pm - +91 88855 50259: Depends on k

06/03/22, 6:50 pm - +91 88855 50259: Because the adjustments that the later base learners make will be made less effective with increase in learning rate
06/03/22, 6:54 pm - +91 98933 88933: Learning rate in GBDT is same as shrinkage parameter
06/03/22, 6:55 pm - +91 98933 88933: lower the shrinkage, more robust the model

06/03/22, 8:07 pm - +91 91762 75222: There is no hyper param like that right?
We eta only...
Hyper param is C
06/03/22, 8:08 pm - +91 99721 79093: No No the question was how does the epsilon value contribute to the over fitting or under fitting of a model

06/03/22, 8:15 pm - +91 93464 10791: What was the coefficient of determination?
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 84476 21501: Sure?
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 99721 79093: Is this the right order or the inverse is right?
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 88510 78354: It was first option i guess
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 84476 21501: 2nd
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 88510 78354: M1>M2>M3
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 94882 02727: No, first option was the opposite of it
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 88510 78354: Acc to me
06/03/22, 8:16 pm - +91 99721 79093: I have 2 nd

06/03/22, 8:17 pm - +91 84476 21501: What is correct,i marked same as u
06/03/22, 8:17 pm - +91 88510 78354: So roc must be high

06/03/22, 8:22 pm - +91 99721 79093: What is the equation of logistic regression
06/03/22, 8:23 pm - +91 83300 49953: Isn't ROC defined by the order. So wouldn't all models have same ROC?
06/03/22, 8:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: Ohh this one I think all are same
06/03/22, 8:24 pm - +91 89210 23935: I remembered Sreekanth sir saying that the ordering is relevant rather than the value itself.
06/03/22, 8:24 pm - +91 99721 79093: But it was a MCQ bro not MSQ
06/03/22, 8:24 pm - +91 99721 79093: Oh I see
06/03/22, 8:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: ROC(M1)=ROC(M2)=ROC(M3). Same as in equality
06/03/22, 8:26 pm - +91 88855 50259: Yup, only the order maters for ROC
06/03/22, 8:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: It makes sense too since we calculating tpr and fpr at each thresholds

06/03/22, 8:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: D is correct as weighted average doesn't have -ve. Entropy calculation equation have negative. I was also confused
06/03/22, 8:37 pm - +91 75690 61914: but cos45 value is 0.701 right ?

06/03/22, 8:38 pm - +91 98933 88933: What's the highest scoreüòÖ
I remember someone got 30 last time
06/03/22, 8:38 pm - +91 89715 68712: Shit. Just 20 üò£
06/03/22, 8:38 pm - +91 89715 68712: But this is the highest of mine among all 3 mid terms üòÇü§£

I'm gettin 21 in most of mid term and mock test
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 88510 78354: No
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah but it should have been msq right? Multiple options are right
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 96505 18893: Same mistake
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 88510 78354: 1 is wrong
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 98910 16793: Same with me
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 98933 88933: A option is tricky
Tf never dominates
It should be "do not want IDF values to dominate"
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 98859 04893: 1question not answered for me, save&next button, I clicked it twice
irony next question also had button at same location
06/03/22, 8:40 pm - +91 88510 78354: Because we dont want *IDF* values to dominate

06/03/22, 8:42 pm - +91 82371 27097: If it is indeed 51¬∞, I feel it cannot be approximated to 45. In the mock it was 63 to 65 which was okay. Should we write to them?
06/03/22, 8:42 pm - +91 88510 78354: Highest marks???
06/03/22, 8:42 pm - +91 98933 88933: Cos45 is exactly 0.707 bro
06/03/22, 8:42 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yeah the value was coming approx 0.52 which is none of these but answer showed 0.45 üôÑ

06/03/22, 8:43 pm - +91 90388 76605: Marked none of these
06/03/22, 8:43 pm - +91 88510 78354: No, it was approx 45 only
06/03/22, 8:43 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes 45 degrees is correct
06/03/22, 8:43 pm - +91 99998 58727: I used calculator it showed 0.52
06/03/22, 8:43 pm - +91 94882 02727: Yeah, the value is 0.61 something.
06/03/22, 8:44 pm - +91 98933 88933: I think you forgot to square the rhs
06/03/22, 8:44 pm - +91 94882 02727: In cos theta values, the values are mostly .1 apart
06/03/22, 8:45 pm - +91 98933 88933: 2(1-cosx)=0.7654^2
06/03/22, 8:45 pm - +91 95603 55228: anyone know passing marks?
06/03/22, 8:45 pm - +91 94882 02727: Some other theta would have a good approximation for 0.61
06/03/22, 8:45 pm - +91 98933 88933: Cos(x)=0.707
06/03/22, 8:45 pm - +91 98933 88933: X=45
06/03/22, 8:45 pm - +91 99998 58727: @919893388933 isn‚Äôt this the correct formula?
06/03/22, 8:46 pm - +91 82371 27097: In the solutions, they have not used square though
06/03/22, 8:46 pm - +91 98933 88933: No
06/03/22, 8:46 pm - +91 95603 55228: what is passing marks?

06/03/22, 8:46 pm - +91 94882 02727: I thought these guys twisted the option on purpose.
06/03/22, 8:47 pm - +91 96505 18893: Yeah I also followed the same formula from mock test üòÇ
06/03/22, 8:47 pm - +91 82371 27097: Wow, they used the same formula in the mock solutions that's why I didnt square it

06/03/22, 8:47 pm - +91 99998 58727: Same I did. üòÖ

06/03/22, 8:48 pm - +91 88845 57276: You need to score 40+ out of 100. And atleast 24 in the final exam out of 60
06/03/22, 8:49 pm - +91 89210 23935: Gladly i forgot the formula and used trigonometry üòÖ

07/03/22, 11:22 pm - +91 70734 10928: I think it is for those who have completed the 29 or 30 assignments so they (applied root team ) takes mock interviews before the actual companies interview for the good practice.

In logistic Regression assignment, predicting test data using predict(w,b, X) returns a numpy array. 
But in grader_predict(), predicted values are compared with pandas series. Is there some code in between to be written in grader function ? 
Also predicted values are in decimals, whereas test_category has {0 or 1} labels, should our predictions be rounded ?
Thanks
09/03/22, 5:54 pm - +91 89783 80243: use round () to convert into integer.
09/03/22, 5:54 pm - +91 89783 80243: We have to convert decimal to integer

09/03/22, 10:30 pm - +1 (514) 974-0682: Data engineer and big data engineer are the same?
09/03/22, 10:37 pm - +91 70734 10928: i think big data people use hadoop, spark, scala.
09/03/22, 10:39 pm - +91 99208 18609: Yes it's similar to data engineering, but with more focus on distributed and scalable systems
09/03/22, 10:39 pm - +91 99208 18609: Yes
09/03/22, 10:51 pm - +1 (514) 974-0682: ok.

10/03/22, 1:15 pm - +91 88003 13691: You can count me in ...
10/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 99998 58727: Can‚Äôt they verify if the number of participants increasing?
10/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 72648 49874: i don't know! it is an OTT. there should already be 200+ participants... üòõ

10/03/22, 1:25 pm - +91 72648 49874: every day!
10/03/22, 1:25 pm - +91 72648 49874: join as per your wish
10/03/22, 1:25 pm - +91 72648 49874: the only thing is, since you don't have the subscription to their platform, you would not get the recorded class link.
10/03/22, 1:25 pm - +91 72648 49874: it usually is at 7pm everyday
10/03/22, 1:26 pm - +91 99998 58727: Okay. Do share would like to see their teaching methodology & content
10/03/22, 1:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: Have you attended these classes? How good are they?

10/03/22, 1:31 pm - +91 72648 49874: they are not math intensive. but they are full hands on. people who are teaching may not be very good teachers, but they share the required information to create projects. so these sessions are definitely not the replacement for applied roots but rather some parallel things provided we have time.
10/03/22, 1:39 pm - +91 73825 54571: Is there any other whatsapp platform meant for discussion on course for our batch?

11/03/22, 11:51 pm - +91 97018 27354: 2.5 lakhs! It kinda sucks. Since Sequoia has invested both in Scaler and Byjus. After few years they might get acquired by Byjus and get merged into GreatLearning. Scaler and most "edtech" companies are banking on the fact that big tech companies are expanding like crazy, ergo the placements. I still remember the interview blogs from 2010, it was difficult enough at IITs, now it's common.

12/03/22, 12:27 pm - +91 95603 55228: Discountious function means when point move towards from positive and negative side to zero y should be same side(either positive or negative)
12/03/22, 12:27 pm - +91 73969 82848: I think circle at the point x= a is to be interpreted as not existing ie the curve is discontinous at x = a
12/03/22, 12:29 pm - +91 89210 23935: f(a) is not zero here when x=a. f(a) is negative here
12/03/22, 12:29 pm - +91 89210 23935: It should be zero to be continuous
12/03/22, 12:30 pm - +91 73969 82848: the value of f(a) is way below the point on the curve
12/03/22, 12:32 pm - +91 73969 82848: this explains

12/03/22, 1:09 pm - +91 96310 97922: option A would be valid in case we had the equation of plane as y=w.X + w0
12/03/22, 1:09 pm - +91 88988 90243: correct

13/03/22, 1:47 am - +91 88988 90243: Is set mutable? 
Can you give example?
13/03/22, 1:49 am - +91 88988 90243: Also tuples are immutable
But we can change mutable elements inside tuple like list
13/03/22, 1:52 am - +91 88988 90243: Insertion sort is stable, online, in place sorting algorithm
13/03/22, 2:04 am - +91 88988 90243: Another important thing
Time and space complexity of insertion sort, merge sort, linear search, binary search
Best case worst case
13/03/22, 2:16 am - +91 89210 23935: Set is mutable but it cannot contain mutable elements like list. Mutable means its value can be changed. Tuple is immutable while list is mutable because we can add or remove elements from list. eg: {1,3}.union({2,5})
13/03/22, 2:16 am - +91 89210 23935: Tuples are immutable, it is fixed.
13/03/22, 2:16 am - +91 88988 90243: List inside tuple is mutable
13/03/22, 2:16 am - +91 89210 23935: P.S. Frozen sets exists, they are immutable. Sets are mutable

13/03/22, 11:45 am - +91 99599 32345: 1) I first pass 8 will be compared with 34 and since 8<34, resultant list will be 8,34,64,51,32,21
2)In second pass 64 will be compared with 34 and since 64>34 nothing will change list will remain 8,34,64,51,32,21
13/03/22, 11:45 am - +91 81445 54148: After first pass 

8 34

After second pass 

Will remain same


8 34 64

After 3 pass

8 34 51 64

After 4 th pass

8 32 34 51 64
13/03/22, 11:46 am - +91 88988 90243: oh even though number remains sorted we have to consider pass
13/03/22, 11:46 am - +91 81445 54148: Correct
13/03/22, 11:46 am - +91 88988 90243: So total number of passes for insertion sort = N-1
13/03/22, 11:48 am - +91 89210 23935: For i in range(1, Len(n)).

In, second pass, the first 3 element will be sorted in insertion sort.
13/03/22, 11:49 am - +91 88988 90243: whats the answer?
13/03/22, 11:49 am - +91 89210 23935: In accordance with mock test question, I would chose D
13/03/22, 11:52 am - +91 98933 88933: It should be D
13/03/22, 11:54 am - +91 98933 88933: For insertion sort, the first pass starts from the 2nd element, so after 1st pass it would be:
8, 34, 64, 51, 32, 31

After 2nd pass 64 will be placed at appropriate place (which it already is):
8, 34, 64, 51, 32, 31
13/03/22, 11:54 am - +91 97912 22474: Is this question from mock exam?
13/03/22, 11:54 am - +91 89210 23935: How will be this if it was 2 way merge sort?
13/03/22, 11:56 am - +91 98933 88933: For one question given in exercise, they've considered the bottom up implementation of 2-way merge sort, see this example:

13/03/22, 12:34 pm - +91 89210 23935: Is merge sort stable?
13/03/22, 12:38 pm - +91 89783 80243: Which sorting algorithms are stable?
Some Sorting Algorithms are stable by nature, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Count Sort etc.
Comparison based stable sorts such as Merge Sort and Insertion Sort, maintain stability by ensuring that-
Element A[j] comes before A[i] if and only if A[j] < A[i], here i, j are indices and i < j.
Since i<j, the relative order is preserved if A[i]\equiv A[j] i.e. A[i] comes before A[j].
13/03/22, 12:41 pm - +91 89210 23935: Ok.. merge sort preserves the order so it is stable
13/03/22, 12:42 pm - +91 89210 23935: I have a basic question. How do we find intercepts from the equation w1.x1 + w2.x2 + w0 = 0?
13/03/22, 12:54 pm - +91 82371 27097: Isnt w0 the intercept term?
13/03/22, 12:54 pm - +91 73825 54571: Transfrm into y= mx+c
13/03/22, 12:54 pm - +91 73825 54571: C is the y intercept
13/03/22, 12:54 pm - +91 82371 27097: thanks

13/03/22, 12:58 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think it is the distance from plane to origin.

13/03/22, 1:01 pm - +91 73825 54571: If the plane passes thru origin
13/03/22, 1:01 pm - +91 73825 54571: X=0
13/03/22, 1:01 pm - +91 73825 54571: No

13/03/22, 1:03 pm - +91 73825 54571: Intercepts are unique for each plane
13/03/22, 1:04 pm - +91 70877 58526: There is no intercept for the plane. To define a plane, we just need a normal vector to that plane and dis of the plane  from origin. These 2 things define a unique plane.
13/03/22, 1:04 pm - +91 73825 54571: This can b done
13/03/22, 1:05 pm - +91 73825 54571: Yeah to find slope,x intercept,y intercep only we write equation in slope intercept form
13/03/22, 1:08 pm - +91 98933 88933: Intercept on x1 axis is -w0/w1
Intercept on x2 axis is -w0/w2
13/03/22, 1:09 pm - +91 98933 88933: distance of plane from origin is -w0/||w||

13/03/22, 1:44 pm - +91 70734 10928: To find the intercept, just put that coordinates in the equation of plane, then you will find
13/03/22, 1:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: In this problem, we compared '3.5' with '4'. How does this comparison happens? Because '3.5' is a string of length 3 and '4' is a string of length 1. Are we only comparing the first element?
13/03/22, 1:47 pm - +91 70734 10928: How are you all reading regex ?
13/03/22, 1:47 pm - +91 70734 10928: What type of questions can be asked from this ?
13/03/22, 1:47 pm - +91 88855 50259: You can find the exact implementation in __ lt__ or __ gt__ methods of string class
13/03/22, 1:48 pm - +91 89210 23935: ü§îü§î
13/03/22, 1:49 pm - +91 89210 23935: Thanks for the info. Any short answers?
13/03/22, 1:50 pm - +91 89210 23935: Is only the first element being compared? Or are we talking ASCII sums? I have no idea
13/03/22, 1:53 pm - +91 70734 10928: Here wo is the intercept so if we know the point coordinates and put these cordinate in place of x, y, z and we will get w0
13/03/22, 1:54 pm - +91 88855 50259: Since both of the strings are numbers, it will be the same as integer comparison
13/03/22, 1:54 pm - +91 88855 50259: *or float comparison
13/03/22, 1:58 pm - +91 70734 10928: Do you have like this for searching algorithms?

13/03/22, 2:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: Okay. What if we have '343' > '327'. Since the first characters match, will it compare the second character?
13/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes
13/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: since ascii(4) > ascii(2), it'll op true

13/03/22, 8:53 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think it's asking how many points after decimal. Kind of round off

13/03/22, 8:54 pm - +91 88510 78354: Why not option 2??

2 decimals

Is solution for 'Mandatory assignment: implement logistic regression with L1 regularisation from scratch' discussed in any live session?
14/03/22, 5:22 am - +91 77748 96465: But then there is some optional content also...so I dnt think we have to complete percentage as 100%
14/03/22, 6:51 am - +91 99451 11649: Changing to 100% does not needed..they have their own assessment..they use their back end data..how much time u spend on the content.
14/03/22, 6:53 am - +91 99451 11649: and also it is not needed that some one has to complete the entire content. They should have some cut off on number of hours..
14/03/22, 6:55 am - +91 99451 11649: Finally they should have thier own validation approach..
14/03/22, 7:10 am - +91 73825 54571: People who think so shall do that and viceversa...no controversy here shall be entertained
14/03/22, 7:15 am - +91 99451 11649: Agreed..at the same time if i am doing does not mean that every one should do.

14/03/22, 1:20 pm - +91 89210 23935: I use the completion feature as an indicator. If I don't understand a topic or problem, or if the topic is hard, I mark it as incomplete to save time later.

15/03/22, 10:01 am - +91 88988 90243: No
If you are 30% tax bucket
You can claim this amount and save 79500*30%
15/03/22, 10:03 am - +91 75690 61914: Any idea, under which section we can claim RA?

Q1 - 1.5 IQR and Q3 + 1.5 IQR

But I think it  is the extreme possible values for whiskers. If there is less spread before Q1 or Q3, the whiskers might have shorter length??
18/03/22, 11:18 am - +91 99493 58648: Thanks a ton
18/03/22, 11:18 am - +91 83329 81498: yes. whiskers can have unequal lengths
18/03/22, 11:25 am - +91 89210 23935: I think 1.5 IQR will be there only if the points go beyond 1.5 IQR range. For eg, if the point are within  Q3 + 1.5 IQR, the upper whiskers have shorter length. Is that length the max value?
18/03/22, 11:27 am - +91 89210 23935: Not the length, the upper limit
18/03/22, 11:28 am - +91 73825 54571: Hello Mr.Arun
[Q3+ 1.5IQR, Q1+1.5 IQR ] is the range for which to find if the outlier is present? 
Whiskers don't generate based on these values as far as I know..
18/03/22, 11:30 am - +91 83329 81498: yes

18/03/22, 11:32 am - +91 89210 23935: How do you think we find outliers visually from boxplot?
18/03/22, 11:36 am - +91 89210 23935: I also thought whiskers are drawn at Q1-1.5 IQR and Q1 + 1.5 IQR

18/03/22, 11:37 am - +91 73825 54571: Visually we use whiskers but that is not range of whiskers..thats the range of box
18/03/22, 11:40 am - +91 89210 23935: If the values are [0,25,50,75,999], the whiskers will be at Q3 + 1.5 IQR, which means 75 + 1.5*(75-25) = 150. 999 will be marked as outlier
18/03/22, 11:40 am - +91 89210 23935: right?
18/03/22, 11:41 am - +91 89210 23935: And if the values are If the values are [0,25,50,75,80]. The upper whiskers will be at 80 because it is than 150?
18/03/22, 11:41 am - +91 73825 54571: [0,25,50,75,100]
18/03/22, 11:42 am - +91 73825 54571: Take this

19/03/22, 12:25 am - +91 88988 90243: Power law distribution is nothing but pareto only. Isn't it?
19/03/22, 12:26 am - +91 98933 88933: Pareto is a special case of power law distribution
19/03/22, 12:26 am - +91 88988 90243: Because pareto is something which follows 80-20 rule

19/03/22, 12:31 am - +91 98933 88933: For pareto distribution also, 80-20 rule is followed by only a particular value of alpha
19/03/22, 12:35 am - +91 88988 90243: Yeah
Not exact 80-20
But near to it

Selection are combi
19/03/22, 9:09 pm - +91 88855 50259: Try phrasing what you want to solve the problem. As others mentioned if the phrasing contains the word "selection" it is combination (nCr) else permutation

Probability of all accidents happening on Monday (1/7) ^7

Now we have to take it for all days week

= add the above equation 7 times
It will give 1/(7^6)

20/03/22, 12:12 pm - +91 91762 75222: Can anyone answer for this question
20/03/22, 12:12 pm - +91 94529 09216: ..
20/03/22, 12:13 pm - +91 91762 75222: üëç

20/03/22, 12:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: Say 16 points 1 to 16
20/03/22, 12:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: Or 8 points
20/03/22, 12:32 pm - +91 89210 23935: For [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Q1 = 2 or 2.5 or 3?
20/03/22, 12:32 pm - +91 98209 18938: 2
20/03/22, 12:32 pm - +91 99877 12457: If there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then usually defined to be the mean of the two middle values
20/03/22, 12:33 pm - +91 99877 12457: so i think 2.5
20/03/22, 12:33 pm - +91 72181 64871: <Media omitted>
20/03/22, 12:33 pm - +91 98209 18938: Take floor of 2.5

20/03/22, 12:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: So to find 10th percentile, we use interpolation?
20/03/22, 12:38 pm - +91 99877 12457: 16 = 100percentile ; x = 10percentile if you cross multiply you get 1.6
20/03/22, 12:39 pm - +91 99877 12457: this maybe wrong interpretation üòÖ
20/03/22, 12:41 pm - +91 99877 12457: https://byjus.com/percentile-formula/

This is good explanation
20/03/22, 12:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: Because 1st element will be in 6.25th  percentile (1/16) and 2 will be 12.5th percentile (2/16).

So 10th percentile = x in x/16th such that x/16 = .1, so 1.6th elements.

Maybe 10th perc = 1st element + (2nd element - 1st element)*0.6  using interpolation
20/03/22, 12:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: Okay. Got it!!
20/03/22, 12:47 pm - +91 91306 38007: Is this of course 2 or course 3
20/03/22, 12:47 pm - +91 94529 09216: Are it's course 2
20/03/22, 12:51 pm - +91 91306 38007: Yes but why it's showing subject name as Machine learning ?
20/03/22, 12:53 pm - +91 94529 09216: I don't where you see subject name, but it's subject 2 only
20/03/22, 12:53 pm - +91 94529 09216: Waise bhi name kya rakha h

20/03/22, 12:55 pm - +91 93988 08159: Q 23 regarding Poisson distribution‚Ä¶.isn‚Äôt the variance in a poisson dist lambda^2 ‚Ä¶that means the std dev is lambda right? In the explanation it is given as sqrt(lambda)‚Ä¶can anyone pls explain
20/03/22, 12:55 pm - +91 93988 08159: Thanks in advance

20/03/22, 12:56 pm - +91 94529 09216: No , variance  = lambda
And std dev  = sqrt(lambda)

20/03/22, 12:58 pm - +91 94529 09216: A lot of people have this confusion

20/03/22, 1:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: Given that 3 out of 4 coin flips are head, what is the probability that the next coin flip is a head? Can someone answer?
20/03/22, 1:15 pm - +91 93988 08159: If it‚Äôs a fair coin, the answer is 0.5‚Ä¶bcos it‚Äôs independent of the earlier trials
20/03/22, 1:16 pm - +91 93988 08159: Thank you‚Ä¶I actually read it from thereüòÖ
20/03/22, 1:18 pm - +91 89210 23935: This is a mutually exclusive event and an independent event right?
20/03/22, 1:18 pm - +91 93988 08159: Yes
20/03/22, 1:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: This is case of bernauli distribution, and every trial in bernaulli distribution are independent of other
20/03/22, 1:21 pm - +91 94529 09216: Accha aisi chize aap kitna bhi padh lo, per realise tabhi hota h jab samne questions aye

20/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: Another thinking.. 

[H,H,H, _] is the possibility.

Only H or T can be in the last slot, and H is what we want so favorable_set/total_set = len({HHHH})/Len({HHHH,HHHT}) = 1/2

20/03/22, 1:40 pm - +91 83329 81498: is this because the sample size is small?
20/03/22, 1:42 pm - +91 94529 09216: We reject our null hypothesis, when our p value is < = alpha
20/03/22, 1:48 pm - +91 98933 88933: We already observed the difference of 10 cm

P value is probability of observing a difference equal to or more extreme than 10 cm assuming null hypothesis is true

When we calculated the p value we implicitly assumed that the null hypothesis is true, after that the p value came very less, this means that if null hypothesis were true, chances of observing a difference of 10 cm is negligible
BUT
we have already observed that difference hence observation can't be wrong
But one of these has to be wrong so it's the null hypothesis that's wrong and hence we reject it

20/03/22, 1:50 pm - +91 98933 88933: That point is not complete, in hyp testing we always have one observed value
20/03/22, 1:49 pm - +91 83329 81498: but there's no mention of observing the difference..
20/03/22, 1:51 pm - +91 83329 81498: okay. i just referred to my notes and i have it written as the ground truth. my bad üòÖ
20/03/22, 1:51 pm - +91 89210 23935: Test statistic : u2-u1 = 10 
Null H0 : u2-u1 >= 10 
H1 : u2-u1 < 10 ?
20/03/22, 1:51 pm - +91 83329 81498: got it. thank you guys
20/03/22, 1:53 pm - +91 98933 88933: Null H0 is mu1 and mu2 are same
20/03/22, 1:53 pm - +91 98933 88933: Alt hyp is they're not the same
20/03/22, 1:54 pm - +91 96310 97922: <Media omitted>
20/03/22, 1:55 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes i thought the same, later i realised the wordings should be odds in favor of event A
20/03/22, 1:55 pm - +91 89210 23935: I haven't gone through hyp testing, is this correct?

Test statistic: u2-u1=10

H0 : u2 - u1 = 0
H1: u2 - u1 ‚â† 0
?
20/03/22, 1:56 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually 5/7 is favorable outcome
20/03/22, 1:56 pm - +91 94529 09216: In favour
20/03/22, 1:56 pm - +91 98933 88933: Test statistic= mu1-mu2

Rest is correct
20/03/22, 1:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: What do we call u2 - u1 = 10?
20/03/22, 1:57 pm - +91 98933 88933: Ground truth
20/03/22, 1:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: Got it!!

21/03/22, 10:52 am - +91 70877 58526: Don't* prolong üôèüèª
21/03/22, 10:55 am - +91 88988 90243: That's not mandatory?

21/03/22, 11:22 am - +91 99998 58727: Oho okay
21/03/22, 11:22 am - +91 99998 58727: I thought it was mandatory
21/03/22, 11:23 am - +91 88988 90243: It is mandatory
But these are mcqs not cofes

21/03/22, 2:38 pm - +91 89210 23935: üí°Hi, is there anyone who is doing internship or has done intership in Data Science?
21/03/22, 2:54 pm - +91 99493 58648: ok, Thank you
21/03/22, 3:49 pm - +91 97890 35993: What marks are allocated for assignments?
21/03/22, 3:50 pm - +91 94529 09216: 10 for attendance + assignment
21/03/22, 3:50 pm - +91 88988 90243: 10 for each subjecr
21/03/22, 3:50 pm - +91 94529 09216: For each subject or whole?
21/03/22, 3:50 pm - +91 88988 90243: attendance not mandatory if we finish live recorded sessions
21/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 88988 90243: Each
21/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 88988 90243: 30+60+10
21/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 99721 79093: Is it a good assumption that it's 5 for assignment and 5 for attendance
21/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 99721 79093: Oh okay
21/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: Okay
21/03/22, 3:52 pm - +91 83449 80933: 30 is for?
21/03/22, 3:52 pm - +91 88988 90243: mid sem
21/03/22, 3:52 pm - +91 83449 80933: Cool
21/03/22, 4:00 pm - +91 77760 81697: Is it mandatory to click on complete button after completing recording session ?
21/03/22, 4:06 pm - +91 90388 76605: No
21/03/22, 4:12 pm - +91 88988 90243: yes
21/03/22, 4:18 pm - +91 83449 80933: So, all the assignments allocated to only 5marks ?
21/03/22, 4:19 pm - +91 98933 88933: 10 marks per subject for assignments

21/03/22, 10:48 pm - +91 88988 90243: How will it consider tasteful and delicious as same words Semantically
And not tasti and delicious???
21/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 98933 88933: Word2vec works only for words actually present in the english dictionary
21/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 77748 96465: Tfidf or w2v?
21/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 98933 88933: Because mostly we use model trained on google news dataset which contains proper english words
21/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 88988 90243: Sry w2v
21/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 77748 96465: Tasti word is not present in English...thats y it's not sementically same as delicious
21/03/22, 10:51 pm - +91 98933 88933: It's highly probable that the word "tasti" was never present  anywhere in Google news dataset on which w2v was trained
21/03/22, 10:51 pm - +91 98933 88933: Hence it'll not be able to find that word
21/03/22, 10:51 pm - +91 88988 90243: Makes sense
So there should be some scope to add the data in w2v üòÖ
21/03/22, 10:51 pm - +91 70877 58526: Tasti is no word. Stemming is basically reducing your word from backside till it gets something of a baseform even if it is not meaningful.(though I don't know what is the procedure of word being reduced) and w2v consider only the dictionary words and associations with words that are also present on dictionary that means tasty and delicious would be similar but tasti is no word so tasti and delicious would be interpreted as totally different words.
21/03/22, 10:52 pm - +91 98933 88933: Actually better thing is to not stem
21/03/22, 10:53 pm - +91 98933 88933: Actually for more advanced nlp models like bert these work better without stop word removal
21/03/22, 10:58 pm - +91 88988 90243: üôåüèª
21/03/22, 10:58 pm - +91 88988 90243: Thanks everyone

22/03/22, 12:00 am - +91 89210 23935: This is easily separable, knn will classify well for lower values of k. 
When k>.02*N, here it will classify every point as blue class.
22/03/22, 12:00 am - +91 89210 23935: .02 because beyond 2% of data points, majority will be blue class
22/03/22, 12:00 am - +91 89210 23935: For this specific data set with 2 features
22/03/22, 12:01 am - +91 88988 90243: Agree
Thank you
22/03/22, 9:01 am - +91 88855 50259: W2V algorithm itself should be able to take in any format of worda. But in practice we dont just use W2V as an algortihm, instead we use a pre trained model for practical uses. And the data on which that pre trained model trains is not stemmed or lemmatized
22/03/22, 9:03 am - +91 78935 18350: Applied AI course old students received the cashback on sem fees... didn't receive any confirmation from team after sending, check recent bank transactions. If you haven't received yet, check with the team üëç
22/03/22, 9:05 am - +91 94529 09216: üëç
22/03/22, 9:28 am - +91 95603 55228: cashback for what?
22/03/22, 9:29 am - +91 78935 18350: Cashback on semester fees for old Applied AI students
22/03/22, 9:30 am - +91 72648 49874: Any vectorization methods cannot work well under stemming since stemming loses the value of the word and may return words not available in the dictionary.
22/03/22, 9:32 am - +91 92058 52308: I think they are not working properly after merge with scaler.

I mail them 4 times about cashback , they replied you will get in 3,7,3 days, still I didn't received any cashback.
22/03/22, 9:34 am - +91 99451 11649: One of my frnd got yday
22/03/22, 9:36 am - +91 88988 90243: BOW, tfidf?
22/03/22, 9:39 am - +91 98933 88933: I received yesterday
22/03/22, 9:41 am - +91 92058 52308: I am waiting for Today, then I will mail.
22/03/22, 9:42 am - +91 96184 80572: I got the cash back yesterday
22/03/22, 9:58 am - +91 95370 26661: Got cashback yesterday
22/03/22, 10:21 am - +91 78935 55163: What is cash back all about? Haven't received anything yet? What is amount?
22/03/22, 10:23 am - +91 99865 79062: This is for Applied AI Students. Not for Diploma Guys.
22/03/22, 10:23 am - +91 78935 55163: Oh thanks
22/03/22, 10:28 am - +91 70734 10928: Yes, I have not received
22/03/22, 10:34 am - +91 70734 10928: Can you please tell which mail id you are using to send the cashback request ?
22/03/22, 10:34 am - +91 70734 10928: I sent the email when I submitted the fees but till now I didn't get any reply from their side.
22/03/22, 10:35 am - +91 92058 52308: finance@appliedroots.com
22/03/22, 10:35 am - +91 92058 52308: Now i received the cashback
22/03/22, 10:36 am - +91 70734 10928: In how many days ?
22/03/22, 10:36 am - +91 92058 52308: I mailed them 4 times
22/03/22, 10:37 am - +91 92058 52308: <Media omitted>
22/03/22, 10:37 am - +91 92058 52308: This is last reply
22/03/22, 10:37 am - +91 72648 49874: Yes or aimilar text mining methods. If we are creating classification models then that's a different case.
22/03/22, 10:38 am - +91 70734 10928: Okay, now again I have sent the email. Thanks for sharing.
22/03/22, 10:39 am - +91 88988 90243: You mean bow tfidf does not work well with stemming

I think stemming should be mandatory in BOW
22/03/22, 10:42 am - +91 72648 49874: No. But a good and fast option as compared to Lemmatization
22/03/22, 12:13 pm - +91 75093 58787: U talking about the 10K cashback or something else
22/03/22, 12:18 pm - +91 92058 52308: Yes, 5k each sem
22/03/22, 12:32 pm - +91 78935 18350: How much time is it taking to run logistic regression assignment? My last grader function is running since 1 hr..is it same for everyone.?
22/03/22, 12:34 pm - +91 77748 96465: That shouldn't be the caseüòÖ
22/03/22, 12:34 pm - +91 82371 27097: Not for me. Took a couple of minutes I think
22/03/22, 12:40 pm - +91 77760 81697: What cashback ?
22/03/22, 12:51 pm - +91 78935 18350: Yah my bad. It's going on infinite loop üòÖ i corrected it now
22/03/22, 12:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: Just pay 30k and you will receive cashback of 5 k
22/03/22, 1:10 pm - +91 77760 81697: Not getting bro
22/03/22, 1:16 pm - +91 94529 09216: Are, this is for those, who took applied ai course, not for all
22/03/22, 1:16 pm - +91 94529 09216: If you have done applied ai course, you will get it , else no
22/03/22, 1:22 pm - +91 83449 80933: K Cross validation and K nn is different..I mean both k are different??
22/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ha
22/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 83449 80933: After Finding K only we could compute NN in Dtrain right??
22/03/22, 1:24 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually, we use k fold cross validation, to find best k value
22/03/22, 1:24 pm - +91 94529 09216: We train our model on multiple k values
22/03/22, 1:25 pm - +91 94529 09216: And the one which gives least error, we chose that k value
22/03/22, 1:27 pm - +91 83449 80933: Cool
22/03/22, 1:27 pm - +91 77760 81697: Okay

23/03/22, 1:44 pm - +91 88988 90243: They are calculating optional assignments into it. 
You can drop a mail to team and confirm
23/03/22, 1:46 pm - +91 90324 45343: Have you completed optional as well?
23/03/22, 1:46 pm - +91 88988 90243: No
23/03/22, 3:55 pm - +91 70877 58526: Where is this mentioned?
23/03/22, 3:57 pm - +91 88988 90243: just finish one video from optional ypu will see completion % increased
23/03/22, 3:57 pm - +91 88988 90243: this is for course 3 only
23/03/22, 3:59 pm - +91 94529 09216: Are don't worry much, live classes matters the most
23/03/22, 3:59 pm - +91 94529 09216: If you haven't completed live , just complete them on priority
23/03/22, 3:59 pm - +91 94529 09216: Sir have told it n number of times
23/03/22, 4:20 pm - +91 77748 96465: Alll live or ones that are conducted for our batch only?
23/03/22, 4:24 pm - +91 70877 58526: Oh you talking about the optional case study videos.
23/03/22, 4:24 pm - +91 88988 90243: Yes
23/03/22, 4:55 pm - +91 83449 80933: If we missed to watch in live . Is it okay to watch after recorded?
23/03/22, 5:16 pm - +91 88988 90243: Yes
23/03/22, 5:18 pm - +91 83449 80933: Excluding assignment it just shows completed just 59% in course 3 content..Why so??
23/03/22, 5:21 pm - +91 99877 12457: You might have missed Optinal case studies
23/03/22, 5:21 pm - +91 99877 12457: optional*
23/03/22, 5:22 pm - +91 77748 96465: Case studies won't count towards assessment (10marks) right?
23/03/22, 5:22 pm - +91 85005 93958: Sir told we can complete optional case studies later as well and we don't have to worry about them right now
23/03/22, 5:23 pm - +91 99877 12457: I dont know but without completing these overall completion % of course 3 decreases.
23/03/22, 5:26 pm - +91 83449 80933: I completed that too by just clicking without watching the content
23/03/22, 5:26 pm - +91 77748 96465: That won't work I'm afraid...sir once told they have system wch checks if video is viewed or not
23/03/22, 5:27 pm - +91 83449 80933: But it's just an optional
23/03/22, 5:28 pm - +91 77748 96465: Ya...
I think all videos not marked as optional should be viewed for completion
23/03/22, 5:29 pm - +91 83449 80933: I meant case studies
23/03/22, 5:30 pm - +91 83449 80933: Those all optional right?
23/03/22, 5:30 pm - +91 77748 96465: Yes
23/03/22, 5:34 pm - +91 99877 12457: I dont think we have this üòÇ

23/03/22, 8:20 pm - +91 89210 23935: After the interview with ineuron, one of the most important problem that I had was lack of number of projects. 
I recently contacted applied ai course, they said to have 5 projects.
In ineuron interview, he said have 2 ML and 3 DL end to end projects (including deployment on cloud platforms).
23/03/22, 8:20 pm - +91 89210 23935: I had a mock interview today with ineuron
23/03/22, 8:20 pm - +91 70877 58526: You are a fresher?
23/03/22, 8:21 pm - +91 70877 58526: I have heard mock interviews of ineuron are very good

23/03/22, 8:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: I would like to know if it is necessarily the case. Even for intership? The interviewer said "even for internship" you need this.
23/03/22, 8:59 pm - +91 97018 27354: Did any one download the 32GB zip file?
23/03/22, 9:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: Qustions from ineuron interview..
Python:

What is inheritance?
Why python is interpretted language?
Difference b/w .py and .pyc files.


NO QUESTIONS ON STATS

ML: Questions while walking though case study I did (not end to end)
In kaggle we often get cleaned data, how will you clean the data?
What is disassembly code ( related to case study)

After each questions, he told me to continue with what I was saying about the case study..

Questions were related to the topic I was telling..

What are the featurizations used?
What is hyperopt (because I used in case study)
What is unigram, bigram, etc..
GBDT vs XGBoost
How XGBoost works?
Are you aware that XGBoost performs feature selection internally? (asked because I did feature selection explicitly using SelectKBest from sklearn)
What was the accuracy of the model you trained?
What are the performance metrics for clustering?
What are the performance metrics for classification? ( then asked about confusion matrix)
How gradient descent updates weights in case of linear regression? 
Types of logistic regression?
Why logistic regression is called as regression?
Difference b/w svm and logistic regression?
Which is more efficient, SVM or Logistic regression? (he said it's svm, but I answered logistic regression)

Deep Learning:
How neural networks work?
Why sigmoid is used in the last layers?
Why sigmoid are not used in hidden layers?
What is padding is CNN? Why padding?
How RNN works?
What are the unsupervised deep learning algorithms?

23/03/22, 9:18 pm - +91 78935 55163: What price ?
23/03/22, 9:21 pm - +91 89210 23935: They had a life time offer, only reason I bought it. After applying promo code, you get 10% off, so around 6.4k.

I mainly enrolled for the services. I didn't watched any of their videos, the recorded live sessions are very lengthy. But we can demand for courses.
23/03/22, 9:22 pm - +91 78935 55163: Yeah live video are lengthy
23/03/22, 9:26 pm - +91 77748 96465: What features/services will be beneficial for us?
23/03/22, 9:28 pm - +91 88844 76831: How is the course content? Just wanted to understand the course coverage
23/03/22, 9:32 pm - +91 99998 58727: Which all projects you mentioned in the resume can you share that as well?
23/03/22, 9:33 pm - +91 99998 58727: To get an idea what kind of questions can be asked based on projects
23/03/22, 9:35 pm - +91 89210 23935: I haven't used their platform much, I had interview prep and resume review sessions today. It was really helpful. 

Regarding the contents, there are different instructors. Can't tell a general opinion because I just skimmed through it. But broad range of topics are there.

23/03/22, 9:42 pm - +91 89210 23935: I don't know. @917264849874  might know in detail
23/03/22, 9:42 pm - +91 89210 23935: The courses are not ordered but there is a roadmap section has Data Science roadmap.
23/03/22, 9:42 pm - +91 97018 27354: Hmm.
23/03/22, 9:43 pm - +91 72648 49874: Yes they have projects
23/03/22, 9:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: Tell me which course you want me to review..
23/03/22, 9:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: From this
23/03/22, 9:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: I'm still very new to the platform.
23/03/22, 9:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think we can work together on internships from ineuron (without enrollment)
23/03/22, 9:49 pm - +91 77748 96465: Their internship is available for evryone right?
Like you have select a project yourself and work on it
23/03/22, 9:49 pm - +91 97018 27354: I have 2-3 topics, I want to work on. I was really hoping to work with applied ai people to build a competitive portfolio, but that is probably not going to happen.
23/03/22, 9:49 pm - +91 77748 96465: If I'm not wrng
23/03/22, 9:54 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes. You can also work as teams.
23/03/22, 9:54 pm - +91 89210 23935: On computer graphics?
23/03/22, 9:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: Anyone from first batch, or people who worked on good projects from applied ai course can answer this.
23/03/22, 9:58 pm - +91 88844 76831: I wanted a review on big data and block chain

23/03/22, 10:21 pm - +91 88988 90243: Take this question about tfidf
1. Arun is a good person --- positive class
2. Shubham is a good person -- positive class
3. Divyansh is a good person -- positive class
4. Rohit doesn't go to good school -- negative class

How will tfidf perform in such case? 
Good will get completely neglected by idf
Isn't it?
23/03/22, 10:29 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yes it will become 0
23/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: That's exact role of idf
23/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 94529 09216: To reduce the importance of that word , which occurs many numbers of time

23/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 88988 90243: So this is a edge case for tfidf
23/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ha
23/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 88988 90243: This was asked in interview today

24/03/22, 1:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: Hey, when I'm loading data into pandas, (say 4 gb dataset), my ram usage increases way more than 32 gb and the instance crashed when using pd.read_csv()

If I'm using 64 gb ram instance, it's impossible to do concat operations. 

Why this is happening? Why is RAM allocating k times more memory than the file size?
24/03/22, 1:22 pm - +91 83329 81498: I think its because of the way python represents the data internally
24/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 83329 81498: you can reduce ram by changing dtype to a smaller one
24/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 83329 81498: if possible
24/03/22, 1:23 pm - +91 83329 81498: or use something like dask

24/03/22, 2:53 pm - +91 89210 23935: I know it's a long comment, but please read it. 
I completed my Mechanical Engineering degree in 2018. I restarted learning machine learning in 2021. I forgot most python syntax, some math etc.. 
But the fundamentals sticked with me, delibrate effort done is always stored in your mind, it is not lost.
Even after years, I could do a front flip after some initial failures because my body changed and it's been a long time - 2012 (which was the last time I did front flip seriously). 
With sufficient effort, we can easily relearn it. 

I recently bought tennis balls to juggle because juggling could improve your focus.
Because of the least priority I gave to it, I didn't tried for 1 month. Now when in the mid of exams, I just tried juggling. 
At first, I speedrun a 5 min tutorial on how it is done. That's it. I went outside took the ball and started juggling. 
Every time I tried, the ball fell. It was very difficult to juggle with 3 balls and I felt like it's a waste of time.
So I thought of juggling with 2 balls. I was able to do it, but I was moving a lot to catch the ball. 
I knew I could do this with 2 balls but since the ball was falling down too often, I decided to focus on the basics. So I started with 1 ball.
Made sure that I am catching the ball perfectly. I did only that on first day. Second day I added one more ball and tried changing the heights. 
Third day, I did again with 2 balls but much better. 4 th day same story. 
I just realized, I am spending my energy to get perfection. It is easy with 2 balls now, now I am in the comfort zone of 2 balls. 
I added 3rd ball to get out of the comfort zone, and it fell again and again. It is tricky.
But after lot of tries, I managed to do one round of improper juggle without the ball falling. It was fun. 
I did lots of one rounds of juggle. Then accidentally, I juggled 2, 3, 4 rounds. IT FELT SO COOL! Suddenly I am getting really good mental rewards for my effort. 
Today is my 6th day of juggling (not continuous days), but today I juggled continuously for 10+ seconds. 
I can do continuous juggling if I spent 15 mins a day for juggling whenever I have time.
I know that I will be able to do juggling with 4 balls, 5 balls, different types of juggling if I continue to push the boundaries.

I know if I practice on something continuously, then I will become good at it and I will feel good about it. No matter how hard it may seem at first, I can start with the easy part (1 ball).

The point I am making is that, don't be discouraged because it seems too hard, or it's been too long. There are too many things on plate, too little time. 
This course is a machine learning gym, take the 2kgs first and add weights and go upto 12 kgs. If you lift 12 kgs, you will probably think you are not strong while infact no one is strong until they build themself to be. 
The most important thing is to not be too hard on yourself, while also not falling into that comfort zone and spent more time on things you think matters for your wellbeing and wellbeing of others.

24/03/22, 10:07 pm - +91 97018 27354: From a job point of view, resume scanners will pick up iitm as a keyword. That's it. Better to work on yourself. Enough courses are there, pick one that suites you. Everything boils down to skills.
24/03/22, 10:07 pm - +91 88886 52319: Agree, but sometimes knowledge from 2-3 sources make you concrete in understanding the concept.

So we should manage everything accordingly
24/03/22, 10:10 pm - +91 97018 27354: Yes better focus on this course. Else we will struggle to finish assignments/thesis next sem.
24/03/22, 10:14 pm - +91 88886 52319: Yes, even I am focusing to complete this course, initially i took it very casually..now realise d, how difficult it is to really complete the syllabus.

Just write your code in python and send appliedroots an email. Try porting the exact code to c++, there are plenty of tools for that. If you know STL then write using stl, the problem is actually ment to be written in C++11/14

25/03/22, 6:21 pm - +91 89210 23935: It just feels weird that the entire dataset is used only inside a constraint üòÖ 
Do we use the dual form to solve this issue?
25/03/22, 6:21 pm - +91 89210 23935: In case of hard margin
25/03/22, 6:22 pm - +91 89210 23935: Dual form in case of soft margin
25/03/22, 6:22 pm - +91 95004 40196: What is the difference between soft margin svm and hard margin svm
25/03/22, 6:24 pm - +91 89210 23935: Hard margin svms work only if the data is completely seperable. This is often not the real case, so we cut some slack and use soft margin svm so that the svm works even if the data is not perfectly seperable
25/03/22, 6:36 pm - +91 95004 40196: Thank you, so kernal SVM is softmargin right
25/03/22, 6:40 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think dual form works for both soft margin and hard margin as well
25/03/22, 6:41 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Yes.... I have a few doubts in it ? If you understand it please let me know...
25/03/22, 6:43 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: I mailed my doubts to them.... It's 3 days no reply ...
25/03/22, 6:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: I don't know how to answer this. Basically we convert soft margin svm to its dual form using Lagrangian multiplier and math math stuffs then we get an optimization equation. In the optimisation eqn, we have a term X.T * X. We replace it by K(X.T, X) this is called as kernel. If K(X.T, X) = X.T * X (original), it's called linear kernel. This is what I recall

25/03/22, 7:05 pm - +91 98933 88933: You're right, kernel svm is where we only xi's only in the form of xiT.xj which can be replaced by a kernel function which computes similarity of some sort
We converted primal to dual for the purpose of deriving kernel svm
As per me, the hard margin is hardly of any use since we almost never encounter perfectly linearly separable datasets (at least in real world)

26/03/22, 11:10 pm - +91 77748 96465: Even option A is incorrect
26/03/22, 11:10 pm - +91 96184 80572: Is it?

It's not
27/03/22, 11:01 am - +91 94529 09216: Because we splitting a node is probabilistic approach
27/03/22, 11:01 am - +91 94529 09216: But query is just if else condition

27/03/22, 11:35 am - +91 77748 96465: Can we consider (0,1,4)?
Beacuse it's said that all co ordinates should be positive
Also (0,0,5)
27/03/22, 11:37 am - +91 93988 08159: Same doubt
27/03/22, 11:38 am - +91 88510 78354: Yes
27/03/22, 11:40 am - +91 88510 78354: Since Manhattan‚Äôs dist = 5
So, Euclidean distance can only be <= 5 
So just tick all the options <=5
27/03/22, 11:41 am - +91 89210 23935: IMO, (5/3,5/3,5/3) gives min distance and (0,0,5) is one possibility of Max distance. Euclidean distance can be in the range [min,max] for this problem.

27/03/22, 11:47 am - +91 94529 09216: Every combination will give same dist

27/03/22, 12:56 pm - +91 77748 96465: No...I guess
27/03/22, 12:56 pm - +91 77748 96465: Gbdt is sequential...so I think it uses whole data
27/03/22, 12:57 pm - +91 77748 96465: To train base learners
27/03/22, 12:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: Okay. But xgboost uses RS and CS right?
27/03/22, 12:58 pm - +91 77748 96465: Someone pls confirm if I'm correct?
27/03/22, 1:00 pm - +91 89210 23935: Sklearn implementation uses Row Sampling in GBDT. I think in it's basic form it uses whole data without any sampling. Need clarification..
27/03/22, 1:00 pm - +91 89210 23935: Extremely randomised trees use RS, CS and also sampling on thresholds
27/03/22, 1:02 pm - +91 77748 96465: Extremely randomized trees is bagging right? And not boosting
27/03/22, 1:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: It is a variation of random forest, so bagging
27/03/22, 1:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: GBDT in theory doesn't uses randomisation

27/03/22, 1:11 pm - +91 77748 96465: What about xgboost?
Xgboost is just implementation of gradient boosting
27/03/22, 1:11 pm - +91 77748 96465: It uses randomization?
27/03/22, 1:12 pm - +91 94529 09216: Only bagging uses randomisation
27/03/22, 1:12 pm - +91 94529 09216: Not boosting

27/03/22, 1:13 pm - +91 88855 50259: It stands for extreme gradient boosting. It does some more things other than row sampling, col sampling and randomizing numerical thresholds (which sir did not go into)
27/03/22, 1:13 pm - +91 94529 09216: Both gbdt and Ada boosting don't use any kind of randomisation

27/03/22, 2:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: I am not 100 percent sure but no
27/03/22, 2:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: If anyone can confirm
27/03/22, 2:07 pm - +91 77748 96465: Mostly no
27/03/22, 2:08 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Previous batch key says yes and google also says yes
27/03/22, 2:08 pm - +91 94529 09216: But how
27/03/22, 2:09 pm - +91 94529 09216: <Media omitted>
27/03/22, 2:09 pm - +91 98933 88933: when you reach a leaf node, considering it's an impure parition, if there are 5+ and 7- points then prob(+) = 5/12
27/03/22, 2:09 pm - +91 98933 88933: i don't know if it's correct,
27/03/22, 2:10 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: <Media omitted>
27/03/22, 2:10 pm - +91 94529 09216: Random forest for no doubt it is probabilistic
27/03/22, 2:11 pm - +91 94529 09216: This is a about random forest
27/03/22, 2:11 pm - +91 95000 08014: Do we not calculate entropy,  IG and GINI impurity usin prob
27/03/22, 2:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: But if that partition is all +ve, then it's 100% correct even with 1 data point
27/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 94529 09216: That is only to select our featur
27/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 97110 42979: any one have ML sem  3 mock test pdf ... plz share
27/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes that's a corner case I thought
27/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: generally we use min_samples_split
27/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: to avoid overfitting
27/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 98933 88933: don't split when too less points in a leaf node
27/03/22, 2:13 pm - +91 94529 09216: Node
27/03/22, 2:14 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think it can work when our decision trees are not too deep and there are a lot of data points in that partition. I'm not sure.
27/03/22, 2:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: But then the number of data points in each bucket vary..
27/03/22, 2:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: üëç
27/03/22, 2:17 pm - +91 94529 09216: So what's the conclusion
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: It is probabilistic or not
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: ?
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 89210 23935: <Media omitted>
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 89210 23935: not probabilistic
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: üëç
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 89210 23935: For the exam
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Thanks
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 95000 08014: .9 is correct
27/03/22, 2:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: 0.9
27/03/22, 2:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: .92 is also correct right?
27/03/22, 2:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: Even though no options
27/03/22, 2:19 pm - +91 95000 08014: The model predicts 1 90% time

27/03/22, 2:19 pm - +91 95000 08014: Despite actual class being 0
27/03/22, 2:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: For 0.92 FPR is 0
27/03/22, 2:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: But for 0.9 FPR is 1/4
27/03/22, 2:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: TPR is same for both
27/03/22, 2:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: i.e 1/4

27/03/22, 2:25 pm - +91 72045 68400: Missed it!
27/03/22, 2:26 pm - +91 94529 09216: That's also one bad thing, about too much discussion
27/03/22, 2:26 pm - +91 94529 09216: We can't get important thing
27/03/22, 2:26 pm - +91 94529 09216: It hides somewhere üòÇ
27/03/22, 2:26 pm - +91 83449 80933: How knn doesn't produce featyre importance??
27/03/22, 2:26 pm - +91 83449 80933: Feature***
27/03/22, 2:27 pm - +91 89210 23935: We can find similar ones, but no feature importance
27/03/22, 2:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: Are what if we use inverse distance
27/03/22, 2:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: ?
27/03/22, 2:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: Changes for every data points
27/03/22, 2:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: Can we say nearer point are more important
27/03/22, 2:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: Technically it seems yes
27/03/22, 2:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes. Points, not features
27/03/22, 2:28 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ha

27/03/22, 2:44 pm - +91 80138 23518: is this the mid term one?
27/03/22, 2:45 pm - +91 89210 23935: Mock test
27/03/22, 2:48 pm - +91 88844 76831: Thank you üòä
27/03/22, 2:48 pm - +91 89210 23935: I did it in a different way. I used only f3 = f1¬≤ + f2¬≤. f3 = 25 gave best classification out of all options
27/03/22, 2:49 pm - +91 89210 23935: F3 can represented in a number line with different classes
27/03/22, 2:51 pm - +91 89210 23935: Or you can consider it as linear classifier with feature transformation as f¬≤ with weights, w = [1,1] and find best b.
27/03/22, 2:55 pm - +91 89210 23935: From previous patterns, I hope they won't ask hard questions ü§û
27/03/22, 2:56 pm - +91 89210 23935: *questions from hard category
27/03/22, 2:57 pm - +91 94529 09216: I also noticed that
27/03/22, 2:57 pm - +91 94529 09216: But i don't know how do I have 3 papers

27/03/22, 2:58 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think in two papers only the order is different
27/03/22, 2:58 pm - +91 94529 09216: But questions are same
27/03/22, 2:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: Is there any possibility that 1 paper is from 1st batch mid term?
27/03/22, 2:59 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes ques are the same
27/03/22, 2:59 pm - +91 98933 88933: order is diff
27/03/22, 2:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: But they don't shuffle usually right?
27/03/22, 2:59 pm - +91 98933 88933: order is diff for each one of us
27/03/22, 3:00 pm - +91 94529 09216: 1 mock and 1 mid term , I got from this group only
27/03/22, 3:00 pm - +91 98933 88933: ques are shuffled among one category
27/03/22, 3:00 pm - +91 98933 88933: category (easy/medium/hard)
27/03/22, 3:00 pm - +91 94529 09216: And one i printed my own

27/03/22, 3:07 pm - +91 88988 90243: - should be there
27/03/22, 3:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: Entropy already has negative sign in it
27/03/22, 3:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: No need to make it negative again

27/03/22, 3:32 pm - +91 89210 23935: It's probably not that important. It's better to revise LOF, reachability distance, SVR etc by that time.
27/03/22, 3:32 pm - +91 94529 09216: LOF to mujhe kuch samajh hi nahi aya
27/03/22, 3:32 pm - +91 94529 09216: Sirf reachability distance
27/03/22, 3:32 pm - +91 94529 09216: Hi samajh aya
27/03/22, 3:35 pm - +91 89210 23935: TPR = Recall = Sensitivity
Precision = Specificity?
27/03/22, 3:36 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think FPR is specifity
27/03/22, 3:37 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yes FPR is specificity

27/03/22, 3:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: Actually when I was reading about roc curve, that's where I read it
27/03/22, 3:46 pm - +91 89210 23935: R¬≤ can be in the range [-1,+1] correct?
27/03/22, 3:50 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think it should be the answer
27/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: But I was just thinking if it is possible, SSres = 0.4
SS total = 0.02
27/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: Is this possible
27/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: ?
27/03/22, 3:51 pm - +91 94529 09216: Then value can go beyond -1
27/03/22, 3:52 pm - +91 98933 88933: R2 has no boundations
27/03/22, 3:53 pm - +91 98933 88933: Yes specificifty is TNR (negative points ki accuracy)
27/03/22, 3:53 pm - +91 98933 88933: sensitivity is TPR (positive points ki accuracy)

27/03/22, 3:55 pm - +91 89210 23935: Got it..
27/03/22, 3:55 pm - +91 94529 09216: I am also not sure about this
27/03/22, 3:56 pm - +91 94529 09216: I was just telling a scenario
27/03/22, 3:56 pm - +91 94529 09216: If it is possible
27/03/22, 3:56 pm - +91 94529 09216: But sir says, so we can rely on this
27/03/22, 3:56 pm - +91 89210 23935: In mock interview, the interviewer asked me which is efficient. I said, logistic regression. He said no SVM. But train and test time complexity of svm is worse than logistic regression right?
27/03/22, 3:56 pm - +91 89210 23935: Svm vs logistic regression
27/03/22, 3:57 pm - +91 88988 90243: Yes
27/03/22, 3:57 pm - +91 88988 90243: Svm is time taking
27/03/22, 3:57 pm - +91 88988 90243: For linearly separable logistic
If not then kernel svm
27/03/22, 3:58 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah linear svm only. For kernel, it's going to be even worse right
27/03/22, 3:58 pm - +91 98933 88933: But performance of linear svm is marginally better than log reg
27/03/22, 3:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: Why? Is it because of sigmoid function?
27/03/22, 3:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: But how can we say for sure..  doesn't it depend on number of support vector also?
27/03/22, 4:00 pm - +91 98933 88933: in general svm is more advanced algo so more complex than log reg
27/03/22, 4:00 pm - +91 98933 88933: hence usually better
27/03/22, 4:00 pm - +91 98933 88933: log reg has problems with outliers
27/03/22, 4:00 pm - +91 89210 23935: I'm actually in a grey zone on how svm classify at test time..
27/03/22, 4:01 pm - +91 89210 23935: How so, it's squashing far away points right?
27/03/22, 4:02 pm - +91 89210 23935: After a certain distance from hyperplane, every point is squashed near +1 or 0
27/03/22, 4:05 pm - +91 89210 23935: In rbf svm, low sigma means overfitting?
27/03/22, 4:07 pm - +91 99857 22132: Someone please share mid and moc exam papers for subject 3
27/03/22, 4:08 pm - +91 89210 23935: .
27/03/22, 4:10 pm - +91 98933 88933: compare log loss vs hinge loss
27/03/22, 4:10 pm - +91 98933 88933: for high -ve values of zi, log loss >> hinge loss
27/03/22, 4:11 pm - +91 98933 88933: which means log loss gives more weightage to wrongly classified outliers
27/03/22, 4:11 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes
27/03/22, 4:12 pm - +91 78756 85040: Yeah O(klgn)

It would be of great help if you can give pointers to refer

27/03/22, 9:42 pm - +91 96310 97922: Thanks üòÉ
27/03/22, 10:00 pm - +91 72648 49874: I agree with you, my friend, but partially. 

applied roots may not have any relations with FAANG. These companies (the top 5) will directly contact you (or you apply to them), and basis your impressive profile, you'll get shortlisted. Scaler however maybe a different issue. 

hence it should not be about marks, but about concepts.
27/03/22, 10:05 pm - +91 89397 88454: Yeah, for these you have to show your on competition platforms
27/03/22, 10:05 pm - +91 89397 88454: Like kaggle for data science related roles
27/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: Hey, I talked to someone from batch one. From his response, I would say that the biggest success factor will the number of hours you put on assignments and projects. 
Course 4 is going to be okay but course 5 deep learning is going to be tough. In course 6 you will do thesis and mostly on your own with some mentorship. So it's better to do the assignments and start working on projects on your own. ‚úåÔ∏è
27/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 99998 58727: Great ‚úåüèª
27/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 77748 96465: Yes...that's what I anticipated
27/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: This is data from batch 1. I don't know if there will be ant changes in our batch. His experience felt like our story happened 6 months ago. But one thing we have in addition is group and support.

27/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 97018 27354: If you can implement papers from ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, ACL, etc. Then applied scientist positions at FAANG are within reach. ML engg positions are usually filled up with current SDEs employees.
27/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 99998 58727: I talked to sir sometime back to get UOH professor as a mentor. But don‚Äôt know whether it will be now valid or not
27/03/22, 10:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: He said placement support is they will give links, we join and apply for some tests there. 
Their thesis was done individually. Out of 4 options, they can prioritise their interest.
Their batch had more strength.
27/03/22, 10:28 pm - +91 97018 27354: I also emailed but no response, I was super interested in working with that Samsung guy listed as mentor on their site. Profs. at uoh I alway thought will give us soutela treatment.
27/03/22, 10:29 pm - +91 89210 23935: He mentioned something about MakerLabs.
27/03/22, 10:29 pm - +91 97018 27354: Any news abt 1st batch students? Regarding projects/thesis?
27/03/22, 10:29 pm - +91 77748 96465: Bhai u think one project is sufficient?
I think we should start building now itself rather than waiting for thesis

27/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 88988 90243: There are more
27/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: There were about 110 projects to choose from. About 10 of them were extremely difficult. Some of them differed.
27/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 97018 27354: Tanks
27/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 97018 27354: **Thanks (stupid autocorrect)
27/03/22, 10:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: That's when he mentioned makerlabs
27/03/22, 10:31 pm - +91 88988 90243: Makerlabs?
27/03/22, 10:31 pm - +91 97018 27354: For data scientists roles these are good for portfolio building.
27/03/22, 10:31 pm - +91 89210 23935: Their group is not active. After semester 1, their group almost died.
27/03/22, 10:32 pm - +91 88988 90243: Why did they defer?
27/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah..
27/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: Project submission and failed test
27/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: Thesis*
27/03/22, 10:34 pm - +91 89210 23935: It's done in stages, like 7 stage. Mentor will contact like once in 15 days. There is deadline for each stage of the thesis
27/03/22, 10:35 pm - +91 99998 58727: Bdw I didn‚Äôt receive this mail. Is this just a reply to you or everyone received?
27/03/22, 10:35 pm - +91 97018 27354: Better start planning now.
27/03/22, 10:35 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes!!!!
27/03/22, 10:35 pm - +91 97018 27354: What is makerlabs?
27/03/22, 10:36 pm - +91 99998 58727: Anyone here planning to publish paper?
27/03/22, 10:36 pm - +91 77748 96465: ‚úãüèª
27/03/22, 10:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: I'm not clear with it. I think it has to do something with some thesis. I'll try to contact someone else.
27/03/22, 10:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: I'm very interested
27/03/22, 10:38 pm - +91 99998 58727: I‚Äôll be working in that direction but need some good processor for it. 

Industrial project I can bring from MS but we need solid research to publish it in good journal
27/03/22, 10:38 pm - +91 97018 27354: Yes but with UoH seems like wishful thinking. Sir talked abt this 2-3 times on live sessions.
27/03/22, 10:38 pm - +91 99998 58727: Professor**
27/03/22, 10:39 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yeah I had asked in live session but have to clarify if it is really possible or not
27/03/22, 10:40 pm - +91 97018 27354: Any particular conf. you are targeting? Journals are even more pickier than confs.
27/03/22, 10:41 pm - +91 97018 27354: Hey, people do it. Maybe we have to do more homework before approaching.
27/03/22, 10:41 pm - +91 97018 27354: That's my take on this.
27/03/22, 10:42 pm - +91 99998 58727: I have heard ICML and ICLR are two renowned one but there are many depending on research area
27/03/22, 10:44 pm - +91 97018 27354: We should try, even if it takea morw than 6 months.
27/03/22, 10:44 pm - +91 72648 49874: you're right. the idea should either be a novel one or a completely different outlook to solve previously identified problems.
27/03/22, 10:45 pm - +91 99998 58727: Right
27/03/22, 10:45 pm - +91 97018 27354: Yes, some small improvement on previous work.
27/03/22, 10:45 pm - +91 72648 49874: do you have any ideas? we can create a separate group for this and discuss further.
27/03/22, 10:45 pm - +91 97018 27354: That's why it is so imp to implement research papers.
27/03/22, 10:47 pm - +91 97018 27354: I'm studying graphics + rendering on side from coursera Columbia uni course. All good Russian courses from hse got taken down.
27/03/22, 10:47 pm - +91 99998 58727: Let‚Äôs create separate group for all interested ones to discuss paper ideas there
27/03/22, 10:47 pm - +91 97018 27354: Also interested in program synthesis but that would require interest in compilers.
27/03/22, 10:48 pm - +91 99998 58727: I‚Äôm bit more interested in Attribution modeling in Advertising segment
27/03/22, 10:49 pm - +91 97018 27354: I have resources on building toy compilers, but no clue how ml will be uses. Github pilot is doing that.
27/03/22, 10:49 pm - +91 97018 27354: Check ISB folks next door.
27/03/22, 10:49 pm - +91 97018 27354: Thay will be interested in that and publishing.
27/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 97018 27354: **spelling mistakes They
27/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 99998 58727: Yeah
27/03/22, 10:52 pm - +91 99998 58727: Some of Netflix published medium research are too aligned with that theme. Let‚Äôs see first have to confirm from team what‚Äôs the scene now after the merger.
27/03/22, 10:53 pm - +91 97018 27354: Share them. Lets make a separate grp for this.

27/03/22, 11:15 pm - +91 88988 90243: course 6 is only thesis?
27/03/22, 11:17 pm - +91 88988 90243: Clustering algorithms
Semester-2:
Advanced ML(with Deep Learning) [7 credits] : Recommender Systems, Matrix Factorization, Neural Networks, MLPs, Advanced Optimisation methods.
Deep Learning-II [7 Credits]: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, TensorFlow.
Thesis [8 Credits] : Industry or Research focussed Thesis.
27/03/22, 11:18 pm - +91 89210 23935: I think so.. according to the info, by the end of course 5 preparation for thesis starts. Course 6 will be thesis.

In applied ai course, deep learning is about 41 hr course + case study 11 hrs (course 5 in our case).  

Then 3 hours remaining for machine learning design and reinforcement learning. Not sure if they add these materials in course 6
27/03/22, 11:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: Maybe they'll add it as optional in some other section since it's 3 hrs only

28/03/22, 8:01 am - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Will the case studies given for us help in doing these projects?
28/03/22, 8:04 am - +91 78935 18350: Yes it will help very much...i suggest to complete atleast 2 case studies given to us before sem-2 starts..I guess there is a gap of 7-10 days between 2 semesters
28/03/22, 9:55 am - +91 89210 23935: This message was deleted
28/03/22, 9:56 am - +91 89210 23935: Also no one, especially the recruiter won't know you have done it unless it is on GitHub or you have deployed it. Since we are already in a momentum by learning for exam and doing assignment, I think it's the best time to do case studies on ML. Next sem will go for deep learning and projects..
28/03/22, 9:57 am - +91 95582 32982: When the 2nd sem starts?
28/03/22, 10:03 am - +91 95370 26661: This might be a stupid question, but jo case studies diya hai course me, for example that stack overflow one and Microsoft malware one, can we show it on our resume/GitHub?
28/03/22, 10:13 am - +91 89210 23935: I am going to put it in my resume for short term until I have a better one. The reason is that I don't have enough projects. 
Also before starting a completely new project without any guidance, it is best to do a one first from business problem to deployment in a guided fashion (deployment not covered in case study). This will be a good preparation for thesis project also.
28/03/22, 10:13 am - +91 89210 23935: You can put it on GitHub
28/03/22, 10:14 am - +91 95370 26661: Great. Thank you.üëçüèª
28/03/22, 10:18 am - +91 78935 18350: Yes you can put it but it will be better if you also completed the extensions they have suggested for those case studies..if recruiter feels this case study redundant as many of us might have done it and put it on GitHub, you can show the extensions as your own work.
28/03/22, 10:23 am - +91 89210 23935: Also the malware case study has 200+ gb of data. It's not possible to do it in colab or if your system has less ram. I did it in a Google compute platform and it took me lot of time to do it. I used 8 cpu 64 gb ram instance there. It can be done using other methods, but need to learn other libraries like dask.. Even my 64 gb ram instance crashed, and once it crashes you have problems of its own. I won't recommend doing that assignment in the beginning.
28/03/22, 10:23 am - +91 89210 23935: *project
28/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 88988 90243: You can use dask
28/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 88988 90243: Parallel processing
28/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 88988 90243: It will take time but it will run
28/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 83329 81498: It can be done if you have colab pro and google one subscription.
28/03/22, 10:26 am - +91 83329 81498: Someone on AAIC put it on their drive and gave me the link to the dataset. I had colab pro then, and I finished it using that
28/03/22, 10:26 am - +91 89210 23935: Yes it can be done, but not recommended as a beginner
28/03/22, 10:26 am - +91 83329 81498: Yep. I agree
28/03/22, 10:26 am - +91 95370 26661: Yeah that's a nice advice. Thank you.

28/03/22, 11:44 am - +91 83329 81498: There are only three mandatory assignments in the classroom right? SQL is optional?
28/03/22, 11:46 am - +91 75690 61914: Yes. optional. But I'm asking for myself to practice more
28/03/22, 11:46 am - +91 75690 61914: Just incase if somebody is having, it would be helpful right
28/03/22, 11:48 am - +91 83329 81498: Yes
28/03/22, 12:43 pm - +91 78935 55163: Any did assignment to compute A^100?, I am not getting the question
28/03/22, 1:39 pm - +91 99397 77817: Just compute it using numpy on ur machine, and write values of A, B...
28/03/22, 1:40 pm - +91 99397 77817: In the LSH assignment, how do u know if a point is on which side of a randomly generated line??
28/03/22, 1:42 pm - +91 78935 55163: So we need find values of A B C D E only? And  provide in assignment or need write code ?
28/03/22, 1:42 pm - +91 98933 88933: check sign of wT*x

28/03/22, 6:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: We can plot accuracy vs number of principal components and choose the optimal dimension from the plot.
28/03/22, 6:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: Not accuracy, proportion of variance explained vs number of principal components
28/03/22, 6:42 pm - +91 96505 18893: okay and i can use knn, SVM for classification?
28/03/22, 6:56 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah sure. The PCA from scratch jupyter notebook is available in course 2 dimensionality reduction chapter. Classification is done using simple neural networks and CNN in course 5.
28/03/22, 6:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: Knn will take a lot of time though.

29/03/22, 1:11 pm - +91 89210 23935: I have an doubt not related to data science.

"It's not good or bad"
"it's neither good nor bad"
"It's neither good or bad"

Is there any difference between these sentance?

I feel like these all have same meaning but sentence 2 is proper. Also sentance 1 and 3 are similar, and sentance 2 and 3 looks like opposite logically..
29/03/22, 1:13 pm - +91 99451 11649: seems last one is different
29/03/22, 1:14 pm - +91 73825 54571: Neither nor
Either or
29/03/22, 1:14 pm - +91 89210 23935: What about neither or?
29/03/22, 1:14 pm - +91 73825 54571: Shouldnot use such combination
29/03/22, 1:15 pm - +91 99451 11649: it is something like AND gate and OR gate
29/03/22, 1:16 pm - +91 73825 54571: Not good = bad
(~good = bad)
Not bad = good
~( ~ good) = good
29/03/22, 1:16 pm - +91 73825 54571: Negation of negation cancellouts
29/03/22, 1:16 pm - +91 73825 54571: Negation of good is bad

Negation of negation of good is good
29/03/22, 1:17 pm - +91 89210 23935: I understand or, what is 'nor'?
29/03/22, 1:18 pm - +91 73825 54571: Neither this nor that means none of them
29/03/22, 1:19 pm - +91 73825 54571: Either this or that means

29/03/22, 1:26 pm - +91 98209 18938: Good +

29/03/22, 1:30 pm - +91 89210 23935: The first sentence can be grouped either.

"It's not (good or bad)"
~(+ OR -)
- OR +
"It's (not good) or bad"
(~+ OR -)
(- OR -)

Since when we say, "it's not good or bad", it means "it not good, not bad" (~+, ~-) equivalently neutral.
29/03/22, 1:31 pm - +91 89210 23935: Isn't it?
29/03/22, 1:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: So sentance 1 and 2 are neutral in my opinion, 

Charita says, sentence 3 is not used in English
29/03/22, 1:33 pm - +91 98209 18938: "Not good" is one sentiment

From language perspective.
I think it will be safe to use the following.

Either this or that.
Neither this nor that.
Apple or Orange.

Not going to use " not good or bad" in a sentence. When someone use it, I can simply ask to rephrase it to know what people mean by it.
29/03/22, 1:55 pm - +91 89210 23935: From non language perspective, this is interesting

30/03/22, 11:01 pm - +49 179 4111257: I've taken a problem finding the similarity between two job roles id's given the dataset contains the following columns:

job_id: unique ID of a job ad
role_id: ID of a job role assigned to a job ad. There are 180 role IDs in this file. Each job ad has at least one job role, but it can have more than one
years: number of years required
minimum : Whether the specification under "years" is a minimum requirement or a maximum requirement. The former is used when a job ad requires at least 3 years of a job role. The latter is mainly used for junior positions.
For example:
The `minimum`-property is a boolean flag, which tweaks our matching logic on how we handle the value for the `years` property. Let's say, for example, there is a job ad requiring at least 5 years' experience in `software engineering`. Our editorial team will then set `years` to 5 and minimum to `true`. With that, potential candidates will need to have at least 5 years of experience in software engineering, to get a full score.

So, here my task is to determine if there are job role pairings that have a relationship with each other. If there is a relationship, this "degree of similarity" should be quantified with a numerical value between 0 and 1.

Could you please tell me how can I approach this problem?

02/04/22, 2:07 am - +91 89210 23935: Interview question:
Our organization has 100,000 employes, as a part of logo change we need to issue new t shirt to all employees. How would you solve this problem?
02/04/22, 2:09 am - +91 89210 23935: How will you distribute right size tshirt to all of them?
02/04/22, 4:48 am - +91 73825 54571: Take 1000 Random employee measurements and grouping similar measurements based on 2 features lets say height and breadth of t-shirt.
Now finding probability of that for 100,000 employees and distributing them
02/04/22, 4:49 am - +91 73825 54571: Correct me if any mistake! With necessary change
02/04/22, 7:31 am - +91 95000 51421: Take multiple samples,  compute the mean T-shirt size for each sample,  apply CLT to determine what proportion of different T-shirt sizes to be ordered
02/04/22, 7:56 am - +91 91236 65827: I also got
02/04/22, 8:13 am - +91 96505 18893: This is a unsupervised learning problem. I think we will make 3 clusters of s m and l. But then i am not sure. Till now We have only used KNN.
02/04/22, 10:08 am - +91 91131 88923: What all features we are given in data set like employee height, chest size any kind of these details are provided??
02/04/22, 1:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: Assume t-shirt sizes are xxs, xs, s,  m, l, xl , xxl
02/04/22, 1:08 pm - +91 89210 23935: I told the same answer..
02/04/22, 1:09 pm - +91 89210 23935: But we don't have the data yet to cluster. Also, we can use statistical methods which are simpler, and intuitive.
02/04/22, 1:10 pm - +91 89210 23935: You have to decide on how to collect data.. I assumed each employee has a t-shirt that fits like XXL, XL, L, M, S, XS, XXS

04/04/22, 12:27 pm - +91 80138 23518: Exactly the same happened wd one of my neighbour juniors... With due respect to the guy I'm gonna talk about I have a story to say.... 

He's a btech and dt too not a direct science student... From arts to diploma n then engineering... 1st of all dunno such things happen in India... So dt guy was doing absolutely nothing at home n had some failed attempt at business where he hardly gets any family backing... So the other day when I was talking to him I learnt that he has been practising hard for spoken English n getting prepared for the Byju's sales executive job... He told me there r lacs of openings for this post and one of his friends is already earning 55k per month but toils a lot daily....

When he told me about the 10 lacs package his eyes sort of lightened in joy n he has already started thinking bahut paisa kama lenge lag gya to

04/04/22, 12:53 pm - +91 94529 09216: If so, they will ask for more than 10 lakh atleast

04/04/22, 2:39 pm - +91 72648 49874: Scaler content is different

But that's not the issue

There is no edtech regilation on our country

I can start teaching Bengali tomorrow and charge for 5lac and no one will question me from the govt. 

Scaler is not an University from india. Had it been the case some people would have still believed them.

I meant no disrespect to Scaler. I have seen their content and they really have great quality.
04/04/22, 2:42 pm - +91 91236 65827: Edtech has become pure buisness where people are throwing money blindly
04/04/22, 2:43 pm - +91 91236 65827: First the private education system and now this edtech

04/04/22, 2:55 pm - +91 83418 08163: I feel all they are targeting is the middle class and Elite class people and no-edtech is like let's focus on education rather than on hefty fees on pre-recorded videos

04/04/22, 2:58 pm - +91 89397 88454: Yeah I have watched that video for freshers it's not good there, for experienced they are doing good
04/04/22, 2:59 pm - +91 89397 88454: From my point scaler is equal to applied ai for software engineer and  focused product companies. And price is premium.

04/04/22, 10:41 pm - +91 89210 23935: My friend studies their BSc program. Not recommended. Goes unnecessarily detailed into maths and no coordination among professors. 
If we do a comparison to our program, by now they would be still doing some python and probability.
04/04/22, 10:42 pm - +91 88640 27876: Good things take time
04/04/22, 10:43 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah, I'm not taking 3 years
04/04/22, 10:43 pm - +91 77748 96465: This sounds good for 2 years course
04/04/22, 10:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: Since his work, he can't focus on the course. It's not recommended for working professionals
04/04/22, 10:45 pm - +91 89210 23935: Good only for full time students
04/04/22, 10:51 pm - +91 89210 23935: Also costs around 2.5 lakhs
05/04/22, 8:06 am - +91 98209 18938: I think someone in this group was doing iit madras ML Diploma course

05/04/22, 8:21 am - +91 99451 11649: any idea, do we get first sem result this week?
05/04/22, 9:15 am - +91 83300 49953: I have a friend who is doing this. She said, don't expect any kind of placements or anything from it. It's not practical or industry rigorous, it's just a lot of theory. The content is good but not for industry.
05/04/22, 9:30 am - +91 89210 23935: Also the contents are available free on YouTube.
05/04/22, 9:51 am - +91 80138 23518: Then what's the purpose of the course

05/04/22, 2:09 pm - +91 90388 76605: After somedays Srikanth sir will claim that he got job in Amazon by studying in Scalar. So yeah PR stuff.
05/04/22, 2:10 pm - +91 99865 79062: Stupid message.
All nonsense discussions
05/04/22, 2:10 pm - +91 89397 88454: Actually they placed many, but till now only on software engineering.
05/04/22, 2:11 pm - +91 89397 88454: They giving great content with premium money. What's wrong with that.
05/04/22, 2:11 pm - +91 99865 79062: Yes
05/04/22, 2:13 pm - +91 90388 76605: When was the last time we properly got a dedicated live class? Think about when we started the course vs now. I only have problem with that.
05/04/22, 2:13 pm - +91 90388 76605: Also we probably got one class from UOH professors.
05/04/22, 2:14 pm - +91 90388 76605: And believe me the more days will go, the less they will care for us.
05/04/22, 2:14 pm - +91 80138 23518: Dts absolutely on point
05/04/22, 2:14 pm - +91 80138 23518: We have nothing only except the good contents
05/04/22, 2:14 pm - +91 89397 88454: Ah, I'm talking about scaler. You are saying they are giving dump Promotions. I'm justifying it that's all.
05/04/22, 2:17 pm - +91 90388 76605: I have no problem with scalar and all. I don't have huge amount of money, so less I care. But I think in this YouTube channel they should focus on existing students. And it really hurts to see People like Srikanth who used to teach student for 25k only , has joined the big sharks.
05/04/22, 2:18 pm - +91 90388 76605: Yes. And the best assignments. üòÖ I really like doing these

05/04/22, 2:20 pm - +91 77748 96465: Evryone looks after themselves only... nobody will give damn about other most of the times...
So we should stop depending on them...and find a way for us.
It's a harsh truth...ü•≤
Only good thing is we have great content...and we should focus on that
05/04/22, 2:20 pm - +91 77748 96465: +1
05/04/22, 2:20 pm - +91 89397 88454: Bro at the end it's business, I believe that applied ai is damn good than scaler on Data science.  We can accept in that way the content is worth than the Money we gave
05/04/22, 2:21 pm - +91 90388 76605: Right üòÖ the year when I joined TCS and went to Hyderabad , central government banned 2000 rs. ü§£ Why it always happens with me lol ü§£
05/04/22, 2:22 pm - +91 89397 88454: They partnered with scaler, it's their organisation but less share, so they are promoting their company.

05/04/22, 8:16 pm - +91 72648 49874: think about it from this perspective: we want everything at home - only to run this requirement how many companies have built their IT infrastructure - OTT, home delivery, Transport, etc. Hence the variety of softwares required is more, hence the domains are more varied.
05/04/22, 8:17 pm - +91 72648 49874: AI ML aaj ka tech nahi hai ... when our grandfathers used to go to bank, and the manager used to suggest a speific Bond, even in that age they used to have manually calculated data mining models - the so called statisticians used to do it.
05/04/22, 8:17 pm - +91 88640 27876: Course ke naam pe ye jo log loot rhe hai unse thoda frustrated hoon, darwin theory of evolution to har jagah applicable hai

05/04/22, 9:26 pm - +91 70877 58526: Guys all these feelings are justified, one thing we can do is let's start discussions on our ai ml content every week once lectures are released. We can do zoom meetings ourselves, share if any relevant thing experienced at work or knowledge gained from some other course related to that lecture for additional understanding.
05/04/22, 9:43 pm - +91 83418 08163: Best üëç

05/04/22, 10:12 pm - +91 70734 10928: No, they are not fake, they are real but those paper work not done by them but they are having their names there just because they are part of some collaboration and if in one publish a paper from that collaboration then there will be name of every one who is part of that collaboration. That's why they shows so many papers to trap the students for research under their. This is the reality of this. Because I also feel the same so on that experience I am saying this.
05/04/22, 10:29 pm - +91 89210 23935: What happened to the sessions that is supposed to happen every Saturday at 7pm? Last time we participated, close to 50 people attended the poll but less than 10 people attended the session.

The issue with less participation is that, this plan will die soon. 10 people this week means, even less people the next week, in previous case it was 0 the later week because there was no session after than despite of the planning.

To make this successfully happen, atleast there should be handful of people who can attend it every week regardless of how many of them are attending, and there shouldn't be excuses like "this week is easy, no need for session". 
And there needs discussion on what to discuss atleast a day before the session starts so that people get reminded and prepare.

A schedule for the re-examinations will be released soon. You can continue your second semester with everyone else and once you get to know the date, you can prepare for it by yourself and give it.

Thanks,

06/04/22, 9:00 pm - +91 88988 90243: We are extracting more meaningful information right?
06/04/22, 9:01 pm - +91 88988 90243: This columns may have higher correlation with output compared to previous pne
06/04/22, 9:04 pm - +91 89210 23935: Absolute difference of frequency makes sense. It can give some sense of similarity. But why addition in word_Total and freq_q1+freq_q2.. if we are doing logistics regression for example, isn't it possible for model to learn w_i*freq_q1+w_j*freq_q2. When we add this feature again, we are just impacting the weights..
06/04/22, 9:04 pm - +91 89210 23935: Maybe for other models, it might?
06/04/22, 9:04 pm - +91 83329 81498: Iirc in the AAIC comments they said they came up with these features by trial and error i.e., these features improved the accuracy

06/04/22, 10:27 pm - +91 70734 10928: In the video itself sir said they have created all the possible features that may be or may not be useful but they have created, in this word_common and word_share was the important features for the similarity analysis of question pairs.
06/04/22, 10:46 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes he said. I wasn't aware that these were experimental features.

How to filter the numbers in a list by exactly 2 digits and store it in a separate list.
07/04/22, 11:35 am - +91 82917 29337: Can u give an example of what u want to do..
07/04/22, 11:37 am - +91 95370 26661: Suppose i have a list. [1,22,3455,2,12,6] and isme se i want to filter out 2 digits numbers and add it to another list. So answer would be [22,12]
07/04/22, 11:37 am - +91 95813 23427: map list to string and filter based on length
07/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 88988 90243: Convert to string
And length of string
07/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 88988 90243: Or if integer is greater than 10 then filter it
07/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 95813 23427: or try n>10 and n<100
07/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 95813 23427: n>=10*

07/04/22, 3:10 pm - +91 89397 88454: Maybe because could be Srikanth varma, but will be live classes I guess. I suggest if anyone below 6-8 LPA don't enroll it's difficult for you to pay emi. For college students scaler is not good because for software engineering they except canditate to be experienced even though they invite freshers also
07/04/22, 3:11 pm - +91 89397 88454: You'll get diverted if you keep on switching.

07/04/22, 3:14 pm - +91 89397 88454: For data science you can wait for atleast one year if we you want to join scaler, because they are relatively new in that area, moreover they having great mentors on software engineering only.
07/04/22, 3:17 pm - +91 89397 88454: Actually just 25k because if you are intermediate you can pass their candidate evaluation test and then they'll give you 25k bonus

07/04/22, 4:44 pm - +91 72648 49874: guys - my 2 cents. please stop wasting your precious time on finding such useless ads . instead focus on one/two programs at a time at max and spend more time on projects.
07/04/22, 5:02 pm - +91 99451 11649: its enough for now
07/04/22, 5:02 pm - +91 97018 27354: Yes, there are enough free resources from good professors. Try solving their assignments/class projects.
07/04/22, 5:03 pm - +91 97018 27354: One paid course is enough to keep one on a schedule. That's enough, rest is self effort.

07/04/22, 6:51 pm - +91 72648 49874: bit off topic question : did anyone amongst us create any Word clouds as part of their work using Python or R, where cooler color coding was used, and distance between each words in the cloud is noticeable?

08/04/22, 10:05 am - +91 94882 02727: But why do Diploma Students need to enroll in Scalar's program? Did anyone ask the difference btw diploma program and Scalar's program? They encouraging diploma students to enroll in scalar course shows its better than diploma which I dont think soüòê
08/04/22, 10:06 am - +91 89397 88454: I believe that content wise ours is great. Maybe be placement wise because of that premium money we are paying
08/04/22, 10:07 am - +91 94882 02727: Just for interview calls? 2L?
08/04/22, 10:38 am - +91 89397 88454: with good package

08/04/22, 10:41 am - +91 89397 88454: our also great***
08/04/22, 10:46 am - +91 96505 18893: They promised live classes in this course as well but we all know they are not happening.
08/04/22, 10:48 am - +91 89397 88454: yeah I guess, many of them are not available like before, because now a days I'm not getting reply for content related queries
08/04/22, 10:50 am - +91 89397 88454: I'm following them a while, they are very active on software engineering, that's why I said don't join scaler for data science, now they are on initial phase on that they'll stabilize in an year or two, you can enroll after that.  Just my thoughts.
08/04/22, 11:19 am - +91 95582 32982: +1
08/04/22, 11:49 am - +91 72648 49874: my 2 cents (again üòõ) --> one of my friends had shared me her login ID and password for some time, to check out the Scaler's data science program. with all my experience I can say that it is a great program to join, and we will not regret. |

the price is high because: trainers are top notch, and they have dedicated placement team. all good until now. But .... 

2.5 lacs is still a very big amount to be paid by anyone, hence if I could afford it, I will take it, else I am satisfied with AAIC and iNeuron already, and hence I will not waste my time thinking about them. 

rather I would invest this time in doing Kaggle projects... üôÇ

08/04/22, 11:52 am - +91 89397 88454: I have also seen, I have also seen their DSA and System design, I felt like the DSA and System design was top notch.

08/04/22, 3:26 pm - +91 73967 24264: What are the topics covered by scaler that are not part of UOH program? Or how scaler program is better than UOH one?
08/04/22, 3:31 pm - +91 72648 49874: Live classes. Mentors are all from Product orgs. Covers from basic programming to Advanced ML. Quizzes. Exams. Hands on assignments.
08/04/22, 3:32 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think one of disadvantage of our course is that, we don't get quizes or practice problems at the end of every topic
08/04/22, 3:44 pm - +91 95610 76941: Am I the only one who is feeling like we are discussing more about 'Scaler' than  this course and studies. 
All in all we need to accept that scaler is providing better study material and content than this course and charging mammoth amount, which is justified . 
For 80k this course is not a bad deal, still I feel that they should have add more practice based content.
08/04/22, 4:42 pm - +91 83103 59763: Has anyone got link for upcoming Saturday live session tomorrow
08/04/22, 4:43 pm - +91 94529 09216: Link?

08/04/22, 4:43 pm - +91 89397 88454: Yeah, from my knowledge and content wise ours is good
08/04/22, 5:11 pm - +91 72648 49874: Exactly my point
08/04/22, 9:40 pm - +91 96184 80572: Does anyone know a good pyspark tutorial? Please suggest

It is humongous. We have 4 topics to complete in week 4 and then we have 3 case studies end to end in week 5. It's too much. I don't think we will be able to do it with jobs. I think we should ask them for some additional time now itself so that they can do something about it then.

These ITSM systems typically do not expose everything as form objects on their front-ends hence fetching data using applicable libraries in R and Python is very tough.
13/04/22, 11:13 am - +91 96310 97922: U can use web scraping

24/04/22, 3:09 pm - +91 94529 09216: We get emails about companies wanting to hire. Most of the emails/classroom posts are about companies who put out their JDs for people with experience. As far as I can recall, there has only been 1 company which added freshers to its JD (It was Jupiter Neobank for DA). So placement support is nil in a sense.
Most of these are actually for the appliedAI course folks and I remember AppliedRoots telling us (batch-1) that we'll get proper placement support once the project has been submitted. Bippity boppity boop, Scaler takeover happened right before the final viva for the projects. So I would not get my hopes high, also based on how the student query support has been lately.I guess someone else from batch-1 can give a better idea of the placements because I have stopped applying to the positions they share with us (mostly because of the experience level discussed in the JDs)
24/04/22, 3:09 pm - +91 94529 09216: Someone shared this in telegram group
24/04/22, 3:10 pm - +91 77748 96465: Sounds scaryüòÖ
24/04/22, 4:25 pm - +91 88855 50259: What experience level are most of the companies expecting?
24/04/22, 4:37 pm - +91 83300 49953: I talked to a person from applied roots, he said that the final results for batch 1 have not been published. Most companies are waiting for the results to come out.
24/04/22, 6:10 pm - +91 87469 85667: Absolutely right
24/04/22, 6:12 pm - +91 87469 85667: Nowadays their replies are making me feel like They're just trying to clear off with their applied root stakes

24/04/22, 11:32 pm - +91 97018 27354: Just apply(if it says 1-2 yrs exp reqd), even if you are rejected you get an automated rejection email from HR dept. You should then send a thank you note, ask how you can improve your chances next time, ask what your application lacked, etc. In most cases you will get a response or an interview. In my experience this works. Companies like people who don't take no for an answer and are very resourceful. At the end of the day its a business/dhanda, you provide value in exchange for money.
24/04/22, 11:34 pm - +91 97018 27354: Sometimes it takes 500+ applications.

25/04/22, 6:52 pm - +91 73825 54571: That is part wise
They didnt include...that whole thing might be of part-1+part-2
25/04/22, 10:11 pm - +91 72648 49874: My experience says that if we are not able to propagate our solutions or projects as solutions to any applicable buainess problem then it ia difficult to get through the interview even if we have good knowledge. But firstly the resume should be attractive and must have work demonstrated in it ao that it is picked up. Most of it is luck. I wish everyone all the best. If I can help in finding job la for anyone olease do not hesitate to contact me.

26/04/22, 2:10 pm - +91 73825 54571: We got 1 week extension

26/04/22, 2:13 pm - +91 77748 96465: I mean... we have course access till sept 2023 right?
So we can have that much time for course completion also or is just till sept 2022?

26/04/22, 4:17 pm - +91 70877 58526: My experience uptill now has been that diploma is very rushed, trying to cover everything and you only need to get mastry in one topic to make it. So you can choose one, be it deep learning, ml techniques, stats or recommendation systems.
I have heard testimonials of people getting hired on any of these basis. No one can cover all this in such short span time.

Koramangla/HSR I would be careful because of after rain flash floods in certain areas.

29/04/22, 6:11 pm - +91 98933 88933: I think the assignment deadlines are tied to semester end and not to mid term, so all the assignments of sem 2 need to be submitted before last date of sem 2
29/04/22, 6:12 pm - +91 99877 12457: i dont see any new mandatory assignment in google classrooms ? did we get any new assignemnt in sem2 ?

29/04/22, 6:55 pm - +91 95813 23427: they are not even validating optional assignments which were submitted like a month back.

29/04/22, 9:30 pm - +91 91762 75222: Yes correct but according to their statement, we have to complete an assignment as soon as we finish the related content

30/04/22, 8:38 pm - +91 83329 81498: Is it 1203+3456 or 12+34, 03+56?
30/04/22, 8:39 pm - +91 83329 81498: If it 1203+3456, i guess you can do
sum(list(str.replace(" ","").split("+")))
30/04/22, 8:39 pm - +91 83329 81498: I missed converting to int part.
30/04/22, 9:02 pm - +91 82917 29337: .split() always return a list object,hence no need to use list() function..



This can be used:

l1="12 03+34 56".replace(" ","").split("+")

print(sum([int(a) for a in l1]))

03/05/22, 3:10 pm - +91 70877 58526: I think Diploma had very limited number of questions on the wide variety of DSA, you could going ahead think of doing easy -medium level questions from gfg for arrays, strings, recursion, dp, and somewhat trees and graphs
03/05/22, 3:14 pm - +91 89397 88454: It depends bro. If you want to become a data scientist in a good product based company you need to have basic to intermediate knowledge. Otherwise it's not required.

06/05/22, 9:26 pm - +91 83329 81498: You can use a GPU session, but there will be more frequent timeouts on the free version. And if you get timed out often, you sometimes don't get GPU sessions for a few days. Colab Pro is worth it if you require GPU more frequently. But even they have a timeout system that's less punishing.

06/05/22, 9:28 pm - +91 83329 81498: I'm using Lenovo Legion Y7000P. It's one of the first models. A major issue I'm facing is the lack of spare parts. My battery fried a few months after buying it and couldn't find a genuine replacement since then. It's a PC now, not a laptop.

06/05/22, 9:58 pm - +91 83329 81498: never used kaggle for my work
06/05/22, 11:59 pm - +91 97018 27354: Beast; better than premium maxed out Thinkpads(T15g, etc) for dev work. I run my dev server(~110GB) + ~300 chrome tabs + Zoom. Never stress tested with ML, prefer a dedicated linux box for that. GPUs are cheap again, get something with 8-12gb VRAM(RTX 30XX) for ML.

13/05/22, 7:59 pm - +91 91762 75222: Atleast if they provide placements like scaler...then that's enough for us

13/05/22, 7:59 pm - +91 77748 96465: Hope soü§ûüèª

13/05/22, 11:24 pm - +91 97018 27354: Scaler pays people working at MAANG like companies to become mentors. Mentors then get paid by their respective companies for successful referrals. At the very least many of us should get calls for screening, if Scaler management allows this.
13/05/22, 11:25 pm - +91 97018 27354: Have you guys submitted your project preferences?
13/05/22, 11:40 pm - +91 89397 88454: Yeah they'll it too simple applied ai is like great startup and scaler like mnc and they charge 3 lakhs so they have more man power.
13/05/22, 11:42 pm - +91 89397 88454: I have watched scaler data science video it really good but Srikanth varma is top instructor there.
13/05/22, 11:47 pm - +91 97018 27354: That's why they bought aaic. Sir is now the dean of Scaler Neoversity. They are launching MSc programs from June. Fees 4.18 lacs.
13/05/22, 11:48 pm - +91 97018 27354: No time for sessions for diploma folks.

14/05/22, 12:20 am - Nithin: Yes
14/05/22, 12:23 am - +91 89397 88454: Actually the reason I that i chose to become data scientist is there is more demand than supply and handsome salary and it is the future, but now i guess in maximum one year supply will be more than demand..üòÇ

14/05/22, 9:27 am - +91 77748 96465: From what I have read from interview experience of other ppl statistics is very important part wrt to data science interviews especially in top companies...
14/05/22, 10:02 am - +91 89397 88454: Yeah actually if you are really having a passion on data science, nothing to worry. I'm saying it for people with my mindset.

19/05/22, 12:17 pm - +91 83329 81498: I hope not. Because we submitted the options in order of preference.
19/05/22, 12:17 pm - +91 90009 31807: If the number selecting a proj is more, they will choose randomly in opted 5, else i think they follow order
19/05/22, 12:18 pm - +91 95603 55228: ok, got it.
19/05/22, 12:18 pm - +91 95603 55228: is there any choose mechinal related project?
19/05/22, 12:19 pm - +91 90009 31807: Allocating projects based on choices seems to b intetesting algo in itself. üòé

19/05/22, 12:53 pm - +91 70734 10928: But I think it will be a dumb modal because if we are giving five choices in order then automatically it will assign first one  without having any problem in that. üòÇüòÇ

19/05/22, 12:56 pm - +91 90009 31807: The problem is there will b a limit on number of ppl working on one proj and there might be many seeking to work on same proj. I believe same applies to other options.
19/05/22, 12:57 pm - +91 90009 31807: I believe most of our selections follow power distribution
19/05/22, 12:59 pm - +91 90009 31807: Power law *
19/05/22, 12:59 pm - +91 70734 10928: That is totally different. I just commented on that, but true there can be any topic to think more and work upon. 
Please don't take it otherwise,I was Just kidding
19/05/22, 1:00 pm - +91 90009 31807: Dont worry, I was just elaborating.
19/05/22, 1:00 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes, but selection should be random and population I mean selected topics should be high
19/05/22, 1:00 pm - +91 97912 22474: Hi, any idea regarding 15)NFL sports analytics project. What would be the data available, what would be the features, input and output variables, kind of data, etc?
19/05/22, 1:01 pm - +91 70734 10928: Ya no issues üòÄ
19/05/22, 1:04 pm - +91 70734 10928: Hi, please select such topic on that you can work upon at least to complete the semester project because I came to know that the alloted instructors will not help much.
19/05/22, 1:04 pm - +91 90009 31807: Good input
19/05/22, 1:06 pm - +91 97018 27354: Hey guys, it would be helpful if we could move the 1st project meeting after 1st mid term.
19/05/22, 1:06 pm - +91 97018 27354: Those of us who are working, it is not a realistic timeline.
19/05/22, 1:08 pm - +91 97018 27354: 15 days ~ basically 2 weekends + few more hours during workdays
19/05/22, 1:09 pm - +91 97018 27354: Or at least, increase the gap between 1st meeting n second.
19/05/22, 1:09 pm - +91 97018 27354: 1st is basically lit. survey + roadmap planning
19/05/22, 1:10 pm - +91 97912 22474: Oh ok. Thanks
19/05/22, 1:18 pm - +91 97912 22474: Which method does this project require.. NLP or something else?
19/05/22, 1:21 pm - +91 70734 10928: <Media omitted>
19/05/22, 1:21 pm - +91 70734 10928: Like this
19/05/22, 1:22 pm - +65 8337 3637: I think this makes sense. We won't even know what our projects are till next week.. so the 1st meeting would literally be they giving us datasets or pointing us to the kaggle link
19/05/22, 1:23 pm - +91 96310 97922: On what all basis you guys are selecting the projects??
19/05/22, 1:24 pm - +65 8337 3637: 1. Current profile
2. Interest
19/05/22, 1:26 pm - +91 88510 78354: Anyone who chose project 27?
19/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 96310 97922: I suppose we should also see the industry relevance of the project ..
19/05/22, 1:29 pm - +91 96310 97922: And also we will be getting approx 3 months of time ..along with office work and the rest of the course
19/05/22, 1:37 pm - +91 97912 22474: Ok. Thank you
19/05/22, 2:33 pm - +91 94837 76400: Hi, can anyone tell me, how they are going to provide there course content data for project number 9..
What will be the size of data for those thousands of hours content?
19/05/22, 2:34 pm - +91 83449 80933: If you need live nfl data you can connect to hudl.  Hudl is a sports analyst company based on bangalore
19/05/22, 3:00 pm - +91 97912 22474: Ok bro. Thank you
19/05/22, 3:02 pm - +91 97912 22474: Can anyone suggest some of the easy level projects from the list
19/05/22, 4:11 pm - +91 91762 75222: We got 2 mandatory assignments
19/05/22, 4:12 pm - +91 90388 76605: Newly added?
19/05/22, 4:12 pm - +91 91762 75222: Yup
19/05/22, 4:14 pm - +91 73825 54571: Seems like they want us to keep busy
19/05/22, 4:14 pm - +91 94529 09216: <Media omitted>
19/05/22, 4:15 pm - +91 90388 76605: Mandatory assignments, lots of videos and then a project ü•π
19/05/22, 4:23 pm - +91 77748 96465: Do we have to enter only project number or we have to also enter the title in form?
19/05/22, 4:23 pm - +91 73825 54571: Number only
19/05/22, 4:23 pm - +91 77748 96465: üëçüèª
19/05/22, 5:03 pm - +91 98209 18938: Which project u guys selected
19/05/22, 5:03 pm - +91 98209 18938: Some one guide pls
19/05/22, 5:26 pm - +91 98432 25743: Yeah even I need help. Inputs from u guys would be really helpful in choosing the project.
19/05/22, 5:33 pm - +91 89210 23935: I have selected

Based on my my previous experience.
1. 28 - Walmart sales prediction
2. 50 - sales prediction

Based on curiosity, and future plans
3. 92 - EEG sentiment
5. 62 - EEG to improve mooc feedback

Based on my mech background
79. Pump sensor data predictive maintenance. (Not finalized)

I didn't finalize any of this except option 1.
19/05/22, 5:34 pm - +91 89210 23935: Last time, most of my options were related to customer behaviour or financial data. 

I hope they will give proper guidance
19/05/22, 5:40 pm - +91 89210 23935: I'm also looking for group discussion to finalize the options.
19/05/22, 5:40 pm - +91 90357 92877: I really think their guidance is nothing but it's just gonna be like another assignment with some pre-recorded intro video
19/05/22, 5:40 pm - +91 77748 96465: I have opted mostly for banking and NLP problems
19/05/22, 5:41 pm - +91 89210 23935: <Media omitted>
19/05/22, 5:42 pm - +91 91306 38007: We don't have any project related to Customer Life Time Value right ?
19/05/22, 5:42 pm - +91 90357 92877: Bruh they even promised us live sessions and doubt clearing sessions
It has been all downhill since the scaler thing happened, not much expectations from them now tbh
19/05/22, 5:43 pm - +91 77748 96465: Yes that's why I'm bit afraid to pick challenging problem
19/05/22, 5:47 pm - +91 88510 78354: 28 was looking a bit complex to me so i chose 27 as my first priority and then 28 

Although they are similar kind of problem.
19/05/22, 5:54 pm - +91 89210 23935: It would have been helpful if they had provided live session before project.
19/05/22, 6:25 pm - +91 97018 27354: yes
19/05/22, 6:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: We can arrange a live discussion by 8 if people are interested
19/05/22, 6:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: at 8pm
19/05/22, 7:18 pm - +91 88988 90243: Has anyone worked on impala?
19/05/22, 8:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: Did anyone received the reminder mail to submit project list, even after submitting it
19/05/22, 8:41 pm - +91 73825 54571: When will they declare our projects
19/05/22, 8:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: ?
19/05/22, 8:41 pm - +91 73825 54571: Yes
19/05/22, 8:41 pm - +91 94529 09216: Ok cool
19/05/22, 8:41 pm - +91 73825 54571: I did

19/05/22, 9:29 pm - +91 96666 32574: What is markerlab??
19/05/22, 10:10 pm - +91 88988 90243: https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/submissions/
19/05/22, 10:10 pm - +91 88988 90243: nice question
19/05/22, 10:13 pm - +91 83449 80933: There is nothing specific about it. We are going to modify the title shortly. The projects that contain the word 'Markerlab' in their titles are little more difficult to solve, but still the mentors are available to assist the students
19/05/22, 10:15 pm - +91 96666 32574: If the data is huge size...like 113gb..project 30...will we be able to do it on 6gb ram computer...???
19/05/22, 10:15 pm - +91 96666 32574: Thanks for response
19/05/22, 10:16 pm - +91 83300 49953: Yes I also have the same doubt. How do we deal with large datasets?
19/05/22, 10:32 pm - +91 97912 22474: In the recent reminder mail, it's mentioned that we can submit on or before 20th.. so we can submit by tomorrow as well right?
19/05/22, 10:32 pm - +91 90388 76605: We can use Dask as mentioned by sir.
20/05/22, 12:15 am - +91 88844 76831: Can someone please confirm if we are just putting up the project numbers or we are putting up the problem statement along with the project numbers?
20/05/22, 12:21 am - +91 96394 70953: No. Only
20/05/22, 12:21 am - +91 88844 76831: Okay thank you
20/05/22, 1:41 am - +91 97018 27354: Who all are opting for 9, info retrieval from video? How will you approach finding indexing points? It will be hard since sir is writing. Any pointers?

20/05/22, 8:20 pm - +91 99998 58727: Kind of probability measure for an uncertain event. In terms of ML fraud detection has some uncertain events example big amount transaction or transaction at odd timing etc.
20/05/22, 8:20 pm - +91 99998 58727: It can vary with your context of ask.

20/05/22, 9:34 pm - +91 97411 84635: Hi guys any body using MacBook Air

Apple M1 Chip with 8‚ÄëCore CPU and 7‚ÄëCore GPU 
256GB Storage
Apple M1 chip with 8‚Äëcore CPU, 7‚Äëcore GPU and 16‚Äëcore Neural Engine
8GB unified memory
256GB SSD storage¬π

Is above specification good for machine learning 

Can anyone suggest
20/05/22, 9:51 pm - +91 95582 32982: M1 chip is not recommended for Deep learning
20/05/22, 9:53 pm - +1 (514) 974-0682: Amd Ryzen will be better choice
20/05/22, 9:53 pm - +1 (514) 974-0682: Comparing to price to performance ratio
20/05/22, 9:54 pm - +1 (514) 974-0682: And as far as deep learning is concern u can have collab pro account
20/05/22, 9:55 pm - +1 (514) 974-0682: Its a good way to get performance of high end graphics card at cheap price
20/05/22, 10:07 pm - +91 97411 84635: Ok
20/05/22, 10:08 pm - +91 97411 84635: Ok
20/05/22, 10:09 pm - +91 97411 84635: But for personal use and coding other than deep learning softwares like docker and all is 8GB unified memory sufficient ?
20/05/22, 10:34 pm - +91 97018 27354: For serious DL you need min. RTX GPUs; ideally RTX 3060/3080 12GB VRAM. Easy to run out of VRAM while doing CV experiments on toy mobile GPU chips(4-6 GB). M1 now fully supports PyTorch, I face no issues. Look into official documentations.

22/05/22, 11:43 am - +91 89210 23935: I'm trying to process all these. I have seen the email from applied ai course mentioning RBR.
But also we need to see both side of the story. I think it's likely the video will be removed.
I also need clarity on this
22/05/22, 11:43 am - +91 89210 23935: He said "each", so I think so

22/05/22, 12:24 pm - +91 73825 54571: Still he is talking for family but this anger isn't triggered for the sake of money...
22/05/22, 12:24 pm - +91 73825 54571: I can say this
22/05/22, 12:27 pm - +91 83418 08163: Rightly said
22/05/22, 12:34 pm - +91 88988 90243: how verma sir is coming here?

22/05/22, 12:54 pm - +91 93464 10791: I think it's a promotional strategy.
22/05/22, 1:14 pm - +91 97890 35993: i think same statement was made when scalar bought appliedai..
22/05/22, 1:55 pm - +91 94529 09216: I also think the same.
22/05/22, 1:55 pm - +91 94529 09216: We all can only guess
22/05/22, 1:57 pm - +91 94529 09216: Only applied team and rbr sir know the real truth
22/05/22, 1:57 pm - +91 75690 61914: Live sessions from UoH professors is done now, the promise is shifted to live sessions from scalar instructors
22/05/22, 2:02 pm - +91 83084 92458: Agreed. But if it's true , it's really bad. I remember ravindrababu ravula and Srikanth sir started some Applied ML batch in 2017. And then they got separated. But i never thought there's lot of things behind this. Srikanth sir is a great teacher and even Ravi Sir is great teacher. It's shocking.
22/05/22, 2:03 pm - +91 94529 09216: Totally agree üëç
22/05/22, 2:09 pm - +91 96433 93292: When is midterm for subject 4

22/05/22, 2:12 pm - +91 83300 49953: Yes bro. But you'll have to put 4 hours everyday atleast.
22/05/22, 2:12 pm - +91 83300 49953: It's definitely possible

23/05/22, 2:12 am - +91 73825 54571: ü§ï he is damn good at teaching

23/05/22, 10:05 am - +91 94529 09216: Did they send any mail regarding selected project
23/05/22, 10:11 am - +91 98933 88933: nopes
23/05/22, 10:57 pm - +91 87926 47374 left
24/05/22, 12:50 am - +91 88855 50259: No offence, but did he actually lose his mind?
In the past he used to be such a good teacher
24/05/22, 9:35 am - +91 88640 27876: <Media omitted>
24/05/22, 9:44 am - +91 73825 54571: Waiting for scaler offencesüòÇüòÇüòÇ
24/05/22, 10:48 am - +91 78428 89792: In my opinion, He didn't lose his mind. It was intentionally done. He was carrying the anger for their past deeds for so many years and when he saw the condition of Ed-tech sector, He might have thought of putting his thoughts out and then he just burst out.
24/05/22, 11:22 am - +91 78935 18350: I followed couple of his live sessions last 2-3 days recently and understood that he has some issues, he was very rude to all of his unacademy colleagues and they fired him (He openly admitted that). He can't teach anywhere for 4 years under the the agreement of unacademy and they filed multiple legal cases on him. Somewhere in this world of heavy edtech competition and huge aquisitions he lost his spirit of teaching. Once he joined unacademy, his teaching has no enthusiasm and top of that recently scalar bought applied AI for humongous amount. All the co-founders are settled for life, meanwhile he is sitting in an ocean of debts. That triggered him more and he felt that he lost the race even though he is talented.
24/05/22, 11:23 am - +91 96184 80572: Can you please share the link for this class
24/05/22, 11:27 am - +91 78935 18350: I too felt bad once I heard all of this but when he starts speaking fantasy stuff about how he wants to change india, becoming PM, want to give advices to finance minister and all, i thought we completely lost him. He isn't making any sense. He is psychologically imbalanced right now. Many of you might not know him but I was a huge fan of him and his ideologies once upon a time but it's heartbreaking to see him like this.
24/05/22, 11:31 am - +91 75690 61914: Small tip for you if you didn't get the link. Just search scalar in Google n open scalar website n browse for a min then close it. By end of the day you will be seeing the same ad on your Facebook or insta feed
24/05/22, 11:32 am - +91 96184 80572: Did already but was hoping to find the link somewhere on fb page itself.. didn‚Äôt think of ad though.. it might come up.. we never know üòÖ
24/05/22, 11:33 am - +91 75690 61914: Yes. You might see it anytime

24/05/22, 11:34 am - +91 90357 92877: Why are students so invested on the teachers personal problems 
üòÇ
Fan-ism for everything is dangerous
24/05/22, 11:34 am - +91 96184 80572: Different live session though
24/05/22, 11:37 am - +91 75690 61914: Probably you will be getting other one too in sometime

24/05/22, 3:18 pm - +91 88855 50259: His anger towards ed tech was fair. But the next day he wanted to start a political party names raudra and wanted to become the PM. What followed this statement sounded so crazy that I had this doubt.

26/05/22, 12:15 am - +91 98315 06503: There is restaurant recommendation problem. I put it as second choice
26/05/22, 12:16 am - +91 70877 58526: No I am asking about assignment.

26/05/22, 8:14 am - +91 75690 61914: Yes we have but it is optional assignment (Recommendation Systems and Truncated SVD SGD algorithm to predict ratings)
26/05/22, 11:37 am - +91 96666 32574: Appliedroots are asking to take projects which is not in our preference list
26/05/22, 11:37 am - +91 96666 32574: Did any one get call from them
26/05/22, 11:37 am - +91 94529 09216: Not yet
26/05/22, 11:38 am - +91 90009 31807: Did we receive any communication from them ?

26/05/22, 11:39 am - +91 90009 31807: Lets wait for our slot.
26/05/22, 11:40 am - +91 90009 31807: Did they said why they wanted to change ? Is it because of many opting for same project ?
26/05/22, 11:40 am - +91 96666 32574: I said they can not force a project on me...
26/05/22, 11:45 am - +91 88510 78354: Any reason for that?
26/05/22, 11:47 am - +91 96666 32574: They say it's from uoh based on our performance
26/05/22, 11:49 am - +91 88988 90243: Can you please tell us what projects did you select?
26/05/22, 11:50 am - +91 6360 451 084: Did they ask to give ur next 5 choices or are just shoving a random one on u...
26/05/22, 11:50 am - +91 96666 32574: Some random projects
26/05/22, 11:50 am - +91 96666 32574: 57
26/05/22, 11:51 am - +91 91647 37365: So, did they tell about ur score or performance in exams??

26/05/22, 12:14 pm - +91 83418 08163: O
26/05/22, 12:15 pm - +91 83418 08163: Is there anyone who fill the form before 20th and then they were told to choose topics other than your preferred list?
26/05/22, 12:16 pm - +91 87449 23207: Are the results announced?

26/05/22, 12:37 pm - +91 97018 27354: What was their reaction?
26/05/22, 12:42 pm - +91 97018 27354: I think a lot of people have opted for these similar themed topics.
26/05/22, 12:43 pm - +91 83418 08163: Oh
26/05/22, 12:44 pm - +91 97018 27354: I am in touch with few other students, all were interested in bank/loan/credit, stock price topics.
26/05/22, 12:44 pm - +91 83418 08163: I have recently done my MBA in Finance so I thought these would be an ideal choice for me but what to do üòì
26/05/22, 12:45 pm - +91 83418 08163: Yaa as we can see the loans are being given at relatively easier ways and   next comes the recovery and all so..doing something in this topics would be very good i guess.
26/05/22, 12:46 pm - +91 95603 55228: everyone is getting different project than choice project list?
26/05/22, 12:48 pm - +91 95603 55228: ia there anyone get Confirmation for same project as choice project list on call ?

26/05/22, 12:53 pm - +91 75690 61914: Or only calling people whose projects needs to be allocated other than their own choice
26/05/22, 12:54 pm - +91 98933 88933: I think this one
26/05/22, 12:54 pm - +91 70877 58526: Those who got calls, how did your exams go?
26/05/22, 1:00 pm - +91 87449 23207: I tho didn‚Äôt choose only.. I knew this would happen.. in the end they will give their choices only
26/05/22, 1:01 pm - +91 73825 54571: üëåüôè
26/05/22, 1:03 pm - +91 73825 54571: I think one should contact them incase of NO email and NO call from them

26/05/22, 1:07 pm - +91 77748 96465: It's been 2 months since exams got over...still no results

26/05/22, 1:20 pm - +91 99451 11649: I dont see, we will get results this month
26/05/22, 1:21 pm - +91 72648 49874: I got a call where they said that my project is #25
26/05/22, 1:23 pm - +91 95668 19500: ü§î

26/05/22, 1:25 pm - +91 72648 49874: I asked them to email further details like data, submission format,etc.
26/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 70877 58526: Those who got mails, do you guys have a relevant experience in the kind of projects they are assigning.
26/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 70877 58526: ?
26/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 70877 58526: *calls
26/05/22, 1:29 pm - +91 96666 32574: They asked to choose between 25 and 44 and 90
26/05/22, 1:29 pm - +91 96666 32574: I chose 44
26/05/22, 1:29 pm - +91 97018 27354: @917264849874 was that your 1st choice?
26/05/22, 1:30 pm - +91 97018 27354: Or one of your preferences?
26/05/22, 1:30 pm - +91 96666 32574: Who are people getting calls...experienced people??
26/05/22, 1:30 pm - +91 72648 49874: None. I selected completely different items.
26/05/22, 1:32 pm - +91 97018 27354: Wow! Then it is random, probably their mentors are assigning projects they themselves are comfortable with.
26/05/22, 1:33 pm - +91 90357 92877: What was the point of asking us to select when they could have assigned it to usüòÇ
I highly doubt its based on our exam performance, its just for them to make their job easy
26/05/22, 1:34 pm - +91 72648 49874: I think so too, but I hope at least they'll give us some mentorship üòÇ
26/05/22, 1:34 pm - +91 96666 32574: They don't have resources and time as well
26/05/22, 1:34 pm - +91 97018 27354: Exactly, they just want to get it over with.
26/05/22, 1:34 pm - +91 96666 32574: They just want to complete the batch
26/05/22, 1:34 pm - +91 96666 32574: And their hands free
26/05/22, 1:35 pm - +91 89715 68712: True
26/05/22, 1:35 pm - +91 97018 27354: Dada u don't need mentorship. I searched around, it seems applied ai students were hired as mentors. CSK n other founders are nowhere in the picture.
26/05/22, 1:41 pm - +91 73825 54571: üòÇüòÇüòÇüôè might be
26/05/22, 1:44 pm - +91 83418 08163: If it's based on performance then i would be called the last üòÇüòÇ
26/05/22, 2:03 pm - +91 96666 32574: I was searching for project 44...the project is available on kaggle

26/05/22, 2:13 pm - +91 72648 49874: Thanks üòä We all will need actually since understanding their required deliverables is important. E.g. iNeuron. Yhose guys ask for detailed system design document for every project!!! üò≠
26/05/22, 2:19 pm - +91 73825 54571: I think mailing system failed after letter A.üòÇ
26/05/22, 3:14 pm - +91 6360 451 084: 100% spot onüò§
26/05/22, 3:46 pm - +91 78705 81961: Are they calling to provide the project or is there other way by which we have to check??
26/05/22, 3:46 pm - +91 99123 54928: same i asked for other
26/05/22, 4:20 pm - +91 83418 08163: That means I have a companion?
26/05/22, 4:20 pm - +91 83418 08163: No were were left to choose something that we thought we would never want
26/05/22, 4:23 pm - +65 8337 3637: Everyone will have a companion. A single project will be assigned to at least 4 to 5 ppl from what I heard..
26/05/22, 4:23 pm - +65 8337 3637: Also, the periodic calls may not be 1-on-1
But with the group
26/05/22, 4:24 pm - +91 70877 58526: Yea I mean there are 100 projects and 500 of students I believe
26/05/22, 4:26 pm - +65 8337 3637: Sorry, What i meant was each prj will be assigned to "at most" 4 to 5..
So even if most chose a particular one, they will give it to 5 or 6 students only.
 Hence we are seeing these calls going on to switch selections
26/05/22, 4:26 pm - +91 97018 27354: Could have replaced the thesis with another course, advanced deep learning or something, if they didn't have the bandwidth to handle.
26/05/22, 4:29 pm - +91 75690 61914: Did anyone check with first batch students whether the same thing happened with them or not ?
26/05/22, 4:29 pm - +91 6360 451 084: First of all, I don't understand why they can't handle it, they aren't going to provide any decent support anyway.... Applied AI students were provided with support for 5 portfolio projects!! right?
26/05/22, 4:30 pm - +65 8337 3637: Busy with "Free Masterclasses"
26/05/22, 4:31 pm - +91 88510 78354: Previous batch was given a live session on how to proceed with project
26/05/22, 4:33 pm - +91 88510 78354: We all should mail them to conduct a live session
26/05/22, 4:33 pm - +91 97018 27354: Please send a request email. At least recorded video, guidelines for project.
26/05/22, 4:37 pm - +91 83449 80933: I think for them too the thesis assigned just now as like us
26/05/22, 4:40 pm - +91 97018 27354: I saw few live projects hosted by past students.
26/05/22, 4:40 pm - +91 97018 27354: I think most of them finished.
26/05/22, 4:42 pm - +91 97018 27354: Batch 1
26/05/22, 4:43 pm - +91 83449 80933: Batch1 student told me as I mentioned above
26/05/22, 4:44 pm - +91 97018 27354: Maybe students who differed.
26/05/22, 4:44 pm - +91 83449 80933: He haven't do that too
26/05/22, 4:44 pm - +91 97018 27354: Well then some finished n posted.

27/05/22, 6:35 pm - +91 97396 15111: I checked with the first batch students as well and things are not going well from their end as well
27/05/22, 6:49 pm - +91 70877 58526: What's going on with the first batch?
27/05/22, 7:05 pm - +91 91131 88923: Ya I am totally lost for second sem sub.
27/05/22, 7:06 pm - +91 97396 15111: There have been no placements
27/05/22, 7:06 pm - +91 97396 15111: The projects are not taken seriously
27/05/22, 7:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: No need to get lost, the best we could do is complete our syllabus according to plan
27/05/22, 7:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: That's it
27/05/22, 7:07 pm - +91 78756 85040: Can't agree anymore
27/05/22, 7:08 pm - +91 97396 15111: Hopefully the mentors that we get or project are genuine enough to support us
27/05/22, 7:15 pm - +91 99451 11649: Hopefully these people will be kicked out from scaler soonüòÄ

27/05/22, 8:12 pm - +91 96184 80572: Not yet
27/05/22, 8:14 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: Not yet
27/05/22, 8:15 pm - +91 83103 59763: Almost all Projects which I've searched are available on YouTube üòÇ I don't see any value for these project in their perspective
27/05/22, 8:17 pm - +91 90357 92877: 80k lesson to not trust indian ed tech market ever againüòÇ
27/05/22, 8:19 pm - +91 83103 59763: Now this course is freely available on some websites üòÇ, I would have saved 80k if I waited little more
27/05/22, 8:23 pm - +91 97018 27354: Exactly, almost all projects(except 2-3) are available on YT, GitHub or Kaggle. Why are they calling it a "thesis.", why so fancy? Should have called it a capstone project or something. People in ML community will give strange looks if we call it a thesis.
27/05/22, 8:25 pm - +91 97018 27354: N not even assigning projects as per our preferences. üòï
27/05/22, 8:26 pm - +91 83103 59763: First they shown hopes of FAANG, then shown hopes of getting masters from uoh... but I lost interest in this course after I came to know that there are no chances of masters degree possible carrying these credits, I am scared of hopes now
27/05/22, 8:27 pm - +91 97018 27354: Well, they might give you some credits in their upcoming Woolf University MSc in CS/AIML.
27/05/22, 8:27 pm - +91 97018 27354: But not worth it!!!!!
27/05/22, 8:28 pm - +91 90357 92877: Its so clear that all their resources are focusing on making the scaler investors happy
Folks who still have hopes on the placement support better take note and plan accordingly
27/05/22, 8:30 pm - +91 83103 59763: Yea, I will feel little awkward to add my 'thesis' into resume, someone will ask me this question for sure that whether I have taken it from YouTube even if it is my individual work.
27/05/22, 8:30 pm - +91 77748 96465: Never depend on anyone....
If anyone has prepared ML properly..start applying now only
27/05/22, 8:31 pm - +91 88510 78354: It will get worse if we all don‚Äôt drop a mail regarding all of this
27/05/22, 8:31 pm - +91 88510 78354: Let them know what we were expecting and what is happening
27/05/22, 8:34 pm - +91 83103 59763: This was really heartbreaking üíî
27/05/22, 8:36 pm - +91 70877 58526: That is true. The feedback you should reflect how they have let us completely down here.  I understood till live sessions but even the projects are now compromised. Not about the 80k but 1 year of my time is huge, I can't take some time off to prepare thoroughly for the ML part, didn't get to do much hands on because of shit msts or semester exam. Effing mcqs and msqs, what is the point.
27/05/22, 8:36 pm - +91 70877 58526: The feedback should*
27/05/22, 8:38 pm - +91 96184 80572: One person can take lead and send mail..all the people who are ok with sending the mail can be put in cc..we can add Srikanth sir as well along with mentors in to: column

30/05/22, 10:55 am - +91 94529 09216: You can do one more thing, try to derive logistic regression from scratch , focus on every nut bolt of logistic regression, then you can easily relate this to multi layer perceptron.

Some of my friends are getting FOMO because of these courses and enrolling in them. 

Here's my almost free alternative path, if someone doesn't like to read books and blogs. 

Machine Learning playlist from StatQuest channel. (Teaches the same content as AAIC). If Probs and Stats refresher required, checkout Derek Banas videos. 

Mike X Cohen's Deep Learning course from Udemy, better than Srikanth Verma IMO. You'll be able to pickup and read any research paper after this. 

Rajeev Ratan's Computer Vision course on Udemy. This can be replaced with any other speciality course, but this course is too good. 

You'll miss out on JoB gUarEnTeE but if you write decent blogs, be active on LinkedIn and have a good portfolio I don't think it's that hard to get into any company.

03/06/22, 4:35 pm - +91 83329 81498: AAIC deep learning is bad and outdated. For some concepts, he just reads out the original paper in a live session and calls it a day.

Support is very much in progress. Still rule of thumb will be to go with CUDA with lots of VRAM. OpenCL still lags significantly behind on perf. so AMD chips are a no go. https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/pytorch-m1-gpu.html

Similarly he's got courses in machine learning which includes eda, probab stats hypothesis testing but not svm or decision trees. His explanation are to the point and alot of hands on.
In deep learning he has got extensive course, i personally haven't done it but I will surely once this diploma finishes.

So there will be cases to extract different audio at same time fr different links.. if anyone worked on this before, please suggest.. Currently I'm thinking on something based on selenium, not sure if it will work also.

04/06/22, 5:13 pm - +91 90324 45343: Hi Folks,

Please be advised that the UoH is working on declaring the results as soon as possible. We regret the delay in the declaration of the results and we appreciate your patience all this while. In accordance with the New Education Policy (NEP), the Controller of Examination (CE) as mandated by the university, is updating program details in the NEP dashboard. This will result in greater recognition of the program internationally. 

Considering the UoH also offers a wide range of programs in addition to the DAI&ML program, the process of updating the NEP dashboard for all programs has taken more time than it was expected and therefore the delay in publishing the results. You can expect the results to be out in a week or two. We will notify you as soon as the results are ready to be published.

Thanks,
Applied Roots Team

17/06/22, 5:05 pm - +91 83329 81498: Are we really writing the 2nd sem mid-term exams without even getting the first sem exams results? First, they made us pay the 2nd sem fees in a hurry before the 1st sem exams to announce the scaler merger and not lose students. Now, this. Some serious incompetence. I'm lucky I didn't put all my eggs in this one basked. They have enough time to conduct meetups in Hyderabad. But not announce results. I lost interest in this program.
17/06/22, 5:05 pm - +91 96433 93292: Of anyone else facing the same issue can drop a mail too this will surely help to highlight issue
17/06/22, 5:06 pm - +91 96433 93292: Else many of us won't be able to give exam

17/06/22, 5:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: Don't expect too much when they say hard copy. The hard copy of the marklist batch 1 recieved is not that hard, It's basically marks printed on A4 paper. And some were sent to wrong addresses too! So expect further delays.

17/06/22, 6:35 pm - +91 95811 24141: Agree, but Srikanth Sir's explanation is unmatchable (atleast across resources in India)

17/06/22, 6:40 pm - +91 70877 58526: Tbh the deep learning part is not good at all. 
I have done bit of DL and I was shocked watching the videos about how much only high level view is given. Trust me one wouldn't be able to answer any DL question in the interview if they asked you to explain the algo. Staright away formulas are told and you can only just cram them.
17/06/22, 6:41 pm - +91 95610 76941: Yeah, bullshit!!
17/06/22, 6:41 pm - +91 99451 11649: not only 80K, waste of time i.e waiting for marks list
17/06/22, 6:42 pm - +91 95610 76941: Well ,that's unrecoverable.
17/06/22, 6:42 pm - +91 95811 24141: Agree, DL subject seems superficial content
17/06/22, 6:42 pm - +91 99451 11649: The greatest thing still they are able convince more than 1000 people, by saying you get everything what we promised.üòÄ

18/06/22, 12:05 pm - +91 95603 55228: refer this
18/06/22, 12:05 pm - +91 95603 55228: @919820918938
18/06/22, 12:09 pm - +91 70877 58526: Dude each neuron is connected to every neuron in next layer. Here we are talking about fully connected layers. 
Since every connection is associated with weights, you need to picture what the input vector size looks like. In our case it's 8x1 (column because).
This needs to be multiplied with matrix thus as per matrix multiplication rule, it should be 5x8. The 5x8 @  8x1 would result in 5x1 which we need. Then think of this as an input and to have one result in the end we multiply by 1x5.  The second part of this answer is wrong I believe.

18/06/22, 12:22 pm - +91 70018 23701: True. That makes more sense
18/06/22, 12:25 pm - +91 90388 76605: Yes
18/06/22, 12:28 pm - +91 94837 76400: Yes, this should be the answer.

18/06/22, 12:36 pm - +91 88510 78354: Its xi‚Äôs . wi‚Äôs 
So input is [1x8] (each row from dataset) 
And weights matrix should be of size *[8x5] *

which gives [1x5] as input for hidden layer 
And weights matrix to that should be *[5x1]*

which gives us the output.
18/06/22, 12:36 pm - +91 88510 78354: Yes..
18/06/22, 12:43 pm - +91 70877 58526: Yes I was thinking of taking column vectors as input. That's why my answer came out to be 5x8 and 1x5, which evidently is not in options üòÖ
18/06/22, 1:30 pm - +91 77760 81697: Will be there questions on case studies in tomorrow's exam?

18/06/22, 2:34 pm - +91 70132 56454: I have received first communication from applied Roots just an hour ago regarding tomorrow's Mid term exam, No prior intimation non of their contact numbers are being answered
18/06/22, 2:34 pm - +91 89198 62311: Ok Ty so I can only concentrate on exam for now.
18/06/22, 2:35 pm - +91 70132 56454: Unlike first semester when we got proper communication, its  missing during the  second semester..

18/06/22, 3:05 pm - +91 98857 18520: They foscused a lot on merging with scalar.

Literally they fooled nearly 1500 students considering two batches.

No proper support.No proper guidance. Worst administration and never expected this from Applied AI team.
18/06/22, 3:08 pm - +91 95603 55228: little bit agree. now whatever we are Learning only from video. Thats not look enough for exam and knowledge. Many things that are not understandable in video also. there is no one to clear doubt.
18/06/22, 3:08 pm - +91 95603 55228: previous mock test, few wrong formula, pls check before solve

But they promised a lot in this at the end they failed miserably

18/06/22, 5:07 pm - +91 99451 11649: there is no soft corner for anyone. I joined bcaz it is less fee and good faculty.  Dont know after writing all exams whether u get certificate from UOH or not.  That too u will get hard copy of marks sheets after (AROUND) 6 months course completion. üòÄ.
18/06/22, 5:08 pm - +91 99451 11649: Dont want to think too much on this, it is too frustrating.
18/06/22, 5:09 pm - +91 73825 54571: That certificate gonna be edited in photoshop
18/06/22, 5:09 pm - +91 95610 76941: Can we do anything about it?A legal action?
18/06/22, 5:10 pm - +91 73825 54571: How can yu prove quality is not enough
18/06/22, 5:11 pm - +91 99451 11649: Best option some one has to check directly in UOH to know the facts
18/06/22, 5:12 pm - +91 99451 11649: otherwise u will get some convincing  answers to keep silent
18/06/22, 5:15 pm - +91 95610 76941: That sounds better
18/06/22, 5:15 pm - +91 70090 20949: They are going to give diploma that‚Äôs a given as this course was advertised by UOH itself
18/06/22, 5:15 pm - +91 70090 20949: Question is the support that was promised by applied ai team that is missing
18/06/22, 5:16 pm - +91 95610 76941: Indeed.
18/06/22, 5:22 pm - +91 99451 11649: if you observe this is the first time, they are sending multiple reminders this time. They might have noticed not many completed or started this module
18/06/22, 5:23 pm - +91 88885 88053: We are fucked up, and their is nothing that we can do, just hope we get UOH diploma certificate
18/06/22, 5:24 pm - +91 95610 76941: What if we don't get that?
18/06/22, 5:24 pm - +91 95610 76941: Then?
18/06/22, 5:25 pm - +91 79080 85397: And the main thing is placement

18/06/22, 7:37 pm - +91 96433 93292: Yup this is right , they have not fulfilled their promises and we should demand an explanation but also we should focus on our studies
18/06/22, 7:38 pm - +91 90324 45343: Ask them in mail
18/06/22, 7:38 pm - +91 96433 93292: What was the mail about ?? Internet connection
18/06/22, 7:40 pm - +91 90324 45343: Please post previous mocks and our mock PDFs here once again

18/06/22, 8:26 pm - +91 88855 50259: And also the equation for cos distance is wrong in the solution
18/06/22, 8:42 pm - +91 88886 52319: Applied AI ne thug liya sab ko... For acquisition they had to show more annual net income and we became the scapegoats.

We have been given same recorded videos as Applied Ai course of 25K.(freely available on torrent)

In the name of UoH, they have chalked bussiness model to mint money from working professionals in the pandemic and luring for career transitions with huge Salaries.  

This is my personal view and can differ from person to person.

Solution: We can ask some benefits of Scaler.
18/06/22, 9:06 pm - +91 70018 23701: I don't really think they'll give nay benefits

I believe it's waste of time to blame appliedroots and accept it as our mistake. We should start working on ourselves n learn to improve better irrespective of their placement assistances.

18/06/22, 11:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah. To overcome this we initialize with higher value of k and combine similar clusters

18/06/22, 11:12 pm - +91 89210 23935: This is the workaround if you want to go with kmeans. Or you have to go with DB Scan or Agglomerative clustering, which would work for this type of data also
18/06/22, 11:13 pm - +91 95603 55228: option d should be true, right?
18/06/22, 11:13 pm - +91 89210 23935: Agglomorative not guaranteed
18/06/22, 11:13 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes
19/06/22, 12:53 am - +91 89210 23935: In Matrix Factorisation for collaborative filtering video, how are we doing gradient descent?
A = B x C'
We want to minimize Sumofsquares(A - B x C') on valid cells.
But we want to get B and C' from the optimization problem, How do we find that many parameters using SGD?

Do we initialise B and C randomly? Then how do we update its weight?
19/06/22, 1:02 am - +91 98933 88933: Initially we assign B and C randomly

treat these random assignments of B and C as weights and then apply SGD
19/06/22, 1:06 am - +91 99721 79093: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/miguelgfierro_papers-with-code-the-latest-in-machine-activity-6943818309163225088-YH6f?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app
19/06/22, 1:16 am - +91 89210 23935: Then don't we need lots of learning rates as well?
The other problem is B and C are weights multiplied together in a single update step.
I think we need to fix B or C as constants at a time as explained as different algorithm in the next video (Alternating Least Squares).
19/06/22, 1:17 am - +91 89210 23935: Like partial derivatives
19/06/22, 1:19 am - +91 98933 88933: we normally take different learning rates when we have both sparse and dense features together, otherwise one learning rate does well
19/06/22, 1:19 am - +91 98933 88933: for the latter part, I agree with you, ALS is used
19/06/22, 1:31 am - +91 90261 53790: This message was deleted
19/06/22, 1:32 am - +91 89210 23935: I could only think of this as update step.

Aij = Aij - alpha * ([bi1, bi2,...] . [c1j, c2j,...] )

Aij = Aij - alpha * (bi1c1j + bi2c2j+...)

Here all b and c are variables.

If alpha is a vector it makes more sense to have optimal value. Don't know about computational difficulties
19/06/22, 8:57 am - +91 97912 22474: In this question, in the solution it is given that there are only 2 strongly connected components. But, option b is marked as correct. Option b should be wrong right?
19/06/22, 8:59 am - +91 70734 10928: <Media omitted>
19/06/22, 9:30 am - +91 98933 88933: IMO, there are 3 strongly connected components, the 2 mentioned above and Node 11 is the 3rd one

19/06/22, 9:32 am - +91 98933 88933: If u represent M2 as a vector it‚Äôll be [0,1,1,1,1]

similarly you can represent other movies as vectors

Calculate the cosine similarity between m2 and all other movies vectors, you‚Äôll see that one with the highest similarity are m4 and m5
19/06/22, 9:39 am - +91 95603 55228: not 11, 11 is weakly connected. (12,5,6) strong connected
19/06/22, 9:44 am - +91 97912 22474: Oh ok
19/06/22, 9:44 am - +91 97912 22474: Ok. Got it. Thanksüëç
19/06/22, 9:51 am - +91 98933 88933: I mean 11 in itself is a strongly connected component (an individual node can be a strongly connected component)

so the 3 strongly connected components are:

{7,8,9}
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,13}
{11}

19/06/22, 11:50 am - +91 89783 80243: No..it's intersection/union. They have mentioned wrong
19/06/22, 11:51 am - +91 95057 59576: That's  cosine distance
19/06/22, 11:52 am - +91 78599 97820: It should be 3/sqrt(14)
19/06/22, 11:52 am - +91 78599 97820: Intersection/sqrt

19/06/22, 1:18 pm - +91 89210 23935: c means fn_softmax3
19/06/22, 1:19 pm - +91 98933 88933: a.matmul(b)
19/06/22, 1:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yes fn1 and fn2 are right
19/06/22, 1:19 pm - +91 93988 08159: Yes B is correct
19/06/22, 1:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: fn4 also right right?
19/06/22, 1:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: Matmul vs dot?
19/06/22, 1:20 pm - +91 93988 08159: C is wrong bcos we need to sum the exponential values not the original values
19/06/22, 1:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yea
19/06/22, 1:20 pm - +91 98933 88933: dot's output is a scaler, matmul's output is a matrix
19/06/22, 1:20 pm - +91 88510 78354: We can use google colab for this in exam right?
19/06/22, 1:20 pm - +91 98933 88933: no
19/06/22, 1:21 pm - +91 89210 23935: fn3 is taking exponential value only but using a list to do so. list.append(np.exp(i))
19/06/22, 1:21 pm - +91 98933 88933: denominator should be sum of exp(wT*xi), in fn4 it's sum of xi
19/06/22, 1:22 pm - +91 98933 88933: that's why fn3 and fn4 are wrong
19/06/22, 1:22 pm - +91 93988 08159: Yes
19/06/22, 1:22 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah right right
19/06/22, 1:22 pm - +91 93988 08159: This is the reason
19/06/22, 1:22 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes
19/06/22, 1:24 pm - +91 94529 09216: Not the same, if you want to use a.dot(b) then you have to first convert both a and b into nd array

19/06/22, 1:27 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes k-means has the limitation for non globular shapes, i think answer given in mock exam is wrong

19/06/22, 2:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: From today's mock there were no question from time series
19/06/22, 2:19 pm - +91 75690 61914: Here 1*5 is weight or 5*1 is weight vector ?
19/06/22, 2:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: 1*5 is weight
19/06/22, 2:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: 5*1 is transpose of weight

19/06/22, 5:08 pm - +91 75690 61914: Yes. Just few minutes ago we had same discussion. You can refer the chat
19/06/22, 5:09 pm - +91 75690 61914: @918902712939 check this

19/06/22, 5:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: @917774896465 @919560355228  I want to correct myself with the option. K means has affinity towards globular shapes. But I cannot say it is unsuitable for non globular shapes . If two non globular clusters are there far apart, k-means could work.
19/06/22, 5:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: I haven't selected option d in mock test

19/06/22, 5:34 pm - +91 78599 97820: 11 has no follower
19/06/22, 5:34 pm - +91 72181 64871: Since no one is following 11, it has zero followers. Hence, it's been assigned highest weight.
19/06/22, 5:35 pm - +91 78599 97820: 5 has 2
19/06/22, 5:35 pm - +91 89210 23935: Which will have lowest weights? 3,5,12,7?
19/06/22, 5:36 pm - +91 89210 23935: They all have 2 followers
19/06/22, 5:38 pm - +91 95057 59576: Not only this one Many wrong answers In mock papers
19/06/22, 5:38 pm - +91 95057 59576: 3/‚àö14 if you do this in calculator you will get  .8017
Or if you do this on paper you will get 0.642
19/06/22, 5:39 pm - +91 89210 23935: In this problem, does the weights mean the weight feature 1/sqrt(1+|x|)
19/06/22, 5:41 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes

19/06/22, 6:03 pm - +91 89210 23935: t and ||G|| are scalars. ||G|| means L2 norm. (t/||G|| ) * L2norm(G) = ( t/ ||G||)*||G|| = t = .5

19/06/22, 6:16 pm - +91 88510 78354: How to compute  OO_Followee(A,B)??
19/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 89210 23935: It usually comes few mins before exam
19/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 88855 99774: Can someone confirm please? 
I am from Batch 1 so checking if everything is same or not
19/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 98666 19981: Exam is at 7 PM right
19/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 88855 99774: Yeah
19/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 88510 78354: Do we have to look for no. of in direction to A??
19/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 88855 99774: But when I took mid exams in Batch 1
19/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 88855 99774: Test appeared like atleast an hour before with inactive hyperlink
19/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 98666 19981: Same for me
19/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 88855 99774: Great pk
19/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 88855 99774: Ok
19/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 98933 88933: while computing N(A) consider only followees
19/06/22, 6:20 pm - +91 98933 88933: N(A) and N(B) both
19/06/22, 6:20 pm - +91 88988 90243: Thank youüôè
19/06/22, 6:20 pm - +91 88510 78354: Option b should be false right??
19/06/22, 6:21 pm - +91 98933 88933: answer given in mock is right
19/06/22, 6:21 pm - +91 98933 88933: that‚Äôs what i remember
19/06/22, 6:21 pm - +91 88510 78354: Pls explain..
19/06/22, 6:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: That's the cosine distance. Intersection of neighbours of followees / sqrt(N(A)*N(B)). For comparison we can ignore the denominator. 

N(A) intersection N(B) is the number of points both A and B pointing to. (Followee)
N(A) is number of points A is pointing to. (Followee).
Any corrections @919893388933
19/06/22, 6:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: In case of followers we consider arrow pointing towards A to count |N(A)|
19/06/22, 6:26 pm - +91 89210 23935: Assuming neighbour distance 1

20/06/22, 9:59 am - +91 97912 22474: They told about scaler, there was Q&A session, then one on one meet up with the mentors at the end
20/06/22, 10:02 am - +91 77748 96465: Ofcourse they were gonna promote scaler üòÖ
That was the main agenda for the meet-up

20/06/22, 10:19 am - +91 94529 09216: If ever you feel cheated, just talk to anyone who has paid 2.5 lakhs to Upgrad, for the diploma degree
20/06/22, 10:19 am - +91 99451 11649: I dont agree with this...seems u have prior experience.
20/06/22, 10:20 am - +91 99451 11649: Just we expect what they promise and just before selling collected all fees fro sem 2.

20/06/22, 10:20 am - +91 77748 96465: But the problem is...they are not providing anything apart from quality content...like industrial guidance...lectures from UoH faculties...and most importantly no regular live classes
20/06/22, 10:21 am - +91 94529 09216: Totally agree sir
20/06/22, 10:21 am - +91 94529 09216: But still they are better than other
20/06/22, 10:21 am - +91 99451 11649: If you speak boldly they cheated us
20/06/22, 10:21 am - +91 94529 09216: This is what I feel
20/06/22, 10:22 am - +91 95582 32982: I'm jr. Data scientist I've worked variety of project  from simple models like time series/LR to the SOTA NLP tasks on real data so ik what they teach and how they teach bro

20/06/22, 10:24 am - +91 88988 90243: Yes
20/06/22, 10:24 am - +91 99451 11649: Then applied ai course is more cheaper than this
20/06/22, 10:24 am - +91 95582 32982: This course worth only 30k not 80k
20/06/22, 10:24 am - +91 94837 76400: What I feel is, the content and teaching  is good based on my experience but they failed in providing proper support ( live sessions) after merging with scalar..
20/06/22, 10:25 am - +91 94837 76400: 50k for degree
20/06/22, 10:25 am - +91 88988 90243: Except industry experts session everything is in place
20/06/22, 10:25 am - +91 77748 96465: Did u speak to anyone from batch 1?
20/06/22, 10:25 am - +91 95610 76941: Well some YouTube content if not better but equally quality to this. Thats free.

No point in laughing at each other
20/06/22, 10:30 am - +91 77748 96465: I feel this should start now...so we get enough time to prepare

Will you know the response
20/06/22, 10:39 am - +91 75690 61914: Guys who are deferred from batch 1 please clarify my doubt. 
Suppose if one person have got good marks in mid exams but failed in semester exams, do that person need to write mid exams again or only final  semester would be fine ?
20/06/22, 10:41 am - +65 8337 3637: I am from Batch-2 but have clarified this with the team in the past.
What they said is as long as you have "appeared" in mid term - there won't be a re-take of the test.

But you will get a chance to take the sem-end exam in case of no-show or unable to secure 40%..
20/06/22, 10:41 am - +91 75690 61914: Cont...
And if we pass subject 4 n subject 5 and failed to deliver project in sem 2, would we be deferred and do we need write all the subject4 n subject 5 exams again ? Along with project
20/06/22, 10:41 am - +91 78599 97820: True. We are paying 50k extra for degree.
20/06/22, 10:41 am - +91 78599 97820: And everything is same
20/06/22, 10:43 am - +65 8337 3637: Also one more year of the content - unless you discount torrentz and screen recordings
20/06/22, 10:43 am - +91 78935 55163: I have same question
20/06/22, 10:45 am - +91 75690 61914: Guys from batch 1 please respond as so many people from batch 2 didn't write semester 1 exams. It might be helpful for them
20/06/22, 10:46 am - +91 88988 90243: We don't have batch 1 people here I think
20/06/22, 10:47 am - +91 78935 55163: We have few ppl
20/06/22, 10:56 am - +91 88605 79404: Any students from batch 1 hv been placed?

20/06/22, 10:58 am - +91 96433 93292: You will be allowed to write final exams only...
20/06/22, 11:00 am - +91 99451 11649: whether batch 1 got both sem results?
20/06/22, 11:02 am - +91 75690 61914: And please tell us project experience too during batch 1 and we would be careful and follow if anything that needs to be followed
20/06/22, 11:16 am - +91 99536 16768: Not till now..every month they send mail that we will get by month end üòÖ
20/06/22, 11:17 am - +91 83329 81498: What??? Batch 1 students are still waiting for their results?
20/06/22, 11:17 am - +91 83329 81498: that's crazy
20/06/22, 11:18 am - +91 99451 11649: just reconfirm sem1 results also?
20/06/22, 11:18 am - +91 99536 16768: Sem-1 results we have got..sem-2 yet to receive
20/06/22, 11:18 am - +91 83329 81498: I wonder if there are some legal issues they are facing which are stopping them from releasing the results.
20/06/22, 11:18 am - +91 83329 81498: Legal issues with UoH
20/06/22, 11:18 am - +91 83329 81498: When did they write the exams?
20/06/22, 11:19 am - +91 99451 11649: did you receive proper marks sheet fron UOH or only results announcement

20/06/22, 11:20 am - +91 78599 97820: Then i think it will take more time for batch 2
20/06/22, 11:21 am - +91 99451 11649: just we wrote in March ...we have lot of timeüòÄ

During this time, did they provide any placement assistance?
20/06/22, 11:23 am - +65 8337 3637: Lagta hai Second Sem ka paisa UOH tak nahi gaya...
20/06/22, 11:26 am - +91 95603 55228: As i know, Batch 1 semester result declared after one month  and they are waiting for second semester result. They are getting same reply like us. They did exam on March but April -May they finished Project work.
20/06/22, 11:28 am - +91 99536 16768: No we gave exams in January and Project work was over by March

Page 22 has some contact information of UoH coordinators.
20/06/22, 11:30 am - +91 95603 55228: ok ok
20/06/22, 11:31 am - +91 89210 23935: Can you name some degree/diploma program in Data science that offers a better deal than appliedroots?
20/06/22, 11:35 am - +91 83329 81498: The issue is not just with the content. They are providing the same content they used to provide in Applied AI Course, which costs 24k, and they are charging us almost thrice that. You can argue that they are providing an official diploma certificate. But so far 0 students have received it from the previous batch. We just wrote the 2nd sem mid-term exams, without even getting the 1st sem results. Never heard of such things happening in tier 3 B.Tech colleges, let alone a prestigious university like UoH. Moreover, in AAIC, you have to do two case studies, not just one to finish the course. The problem is they are not sticking to their promises when we enrolled. There's a clear dip in their involvement after the scaler merger.
20/06/22, 11:35 am - +91 83329 81498: I'm just disappointed
20/06/22, 11:36 am - +91 83329 81498: Just because their content is better than the rest of the shitty edtech companies, doesn't mean we don't have to complain. Atleast that's what I feel.
20/06/22, 11:39 am - +91 88885 88053: Is there any legal action we can take ?
20/06/22, 11:40 am - +91 95610 76941: +1
20/06/22, 11:40 am - +91 95610 76941: Atleast we mail a complaint to UoH
20/06/22, 11:43 am - +91 89210 23935: Btw applied ai course costs 29.5 k including tax. If you want additional year like in diploma, you need to pay around 17k more. So 46.5k for 2 years access.

Yeah the timeliness and administration is shitty. One point they completely ignored us. I lost my trust in them. 
But contentwise, the course is good till now. I'm saving time instead of browsing through tons of options available online. But won't trust them with placements.
20/06/22, 11:44 am - +91 75690 61914: May be the problem is with UoH only, because the same problems are being faced by batch 1 too.
20/06/22, 11:45 am - +91 73825 54571: No itseems like problem is with Appliedroots admistration
20/06/22, 11:45 am - +91 93464 10791: I think if we are thorough with the content, then we can easily manage to get good placements. I know few people from batch 1 who got placed for 25-30 LPA without placement assistance.
20/06/22, 11:47 am - +91 75690 61914: What appliedroots will do when results should be published by UoH n certificates should be issued by UoH
20/06/22, 11:47 am - +91 89210 23935: The assignments man!! It's really helpful. That's the effort taking part. People are struggling to watch the content itself. Watching videos alone doesn't do any good, assignments helps a lot and also add interest in learning
20/06/22, 11:47 am - +91 75690 61914: And If there is any problem with applied roots, UoH will not spare them for not releasing the results
20/06/22, 11:47 am - +91 75690 61914: It's not like private entity right
20/06/22, 11:47 am - +91 73825 54571: Appliedroots should give consent to results declaration on its authority
20/06/22, 11:48 am - +91 83329 81498: This is also a possibility. Since they are saying UoH updating the NEP dashboard is taking time in the emails.
20/06/22, 11:49 am - +91 75690 61914: I don't think appliedroots will be given such kind of privileges from UoH. Ultimately UoH will be the one because we paid to UoH not applied roots we shouldn't forget that
20/06/22, 11:50 am - +91 93464 10791: It's a waste of time blaming them because Applied roots/Applied ai body is dissolved now. But still, they are keeping up to their promise to an extent. So instead of ranting about them, we could use that time to read up stuff, listening to podcasts, actually writing code, watching videos and start applying for jobs already.
20/06/22, 11:51 am - +91 93464 10791: It's on our own interest we found out about the course. Why drop that interest because of someone's negligency? It's our journey alone. We alone have to fight and figure out!

20/06/22, 11:52 am - +91 75690 61914: Just imagine if appliedroots says to UoH like don't publish results now we have some issues to resolve then only you need to publish results. Do you think UoH will listen to such kind of things ?
20/06/22, 11:52 am - +91 73825 54571: There is little dissatisfaction about quality comprimise
20/06/22, 11:53 am - +91 95603 55228: +1
20/06/22, 11:54 am - +91 93464 10791: I do agree with you on this. But there is no action on their part, right? We have asked them enough about the live sessions, when it is getting delayed we must search for some other alternative.
20/06/22, 11:54 am - +91 93464 10791: I think the best solution to learning is to practical experiment with case studies/ data available on kaggle.
20/06/22, 11:55 am - +91 93464 10791: If most people here are willing, we could form a group and experiment with few datasets every weekend and get our hands dirty.
20/06/22, 11:55 am - +91 73825 54571: Apparently , I can agree with you
20/06/22, 11:56 am - +91 89198 62311: üëçadd me as well if you guys create a group.
20/06/22, 11:58 am - +91 78599 97820: üëçüèª
20/06/22, 12:01 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yes. But also we expected something. There are still things they can fix like industry sessions by experts, resume and portfolio building, better placements maybe along with scaler since it is the parent company now.

We are only having student discussion. If we want something out of it, we have to talk to the lazy/busy/whatever administration. It seems that we need to ask for what we paid for. Right now we are stuck here having discussions about it.

20/06/22, 12:04 pm - +91 93464 10791: That's exactly what I'm talking about. Instead of getting stuck having discussions, we have various other options in our control.
20/06/22, 12:04 pm - +91 93464 10791: If a boat sinks in the middle of the ocean, we have to swim to the shore before we can file a complaint, right?
20/06/22, 12:05 pm - +91 78599 97820: I've sent them my resume for feedback and if any changes are required but no response.
20/06/22, 12:06 pm - +91 78599 97820: I guess we can see online stuffs for resume.
There are plenty available.
20/06/22, 12:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: We can swim, but also we can wake up the engineers in the boat and tell them to fix it so we can reach safely to the shore.
20/06/22, 12:07 pm - +91 78599 97820: I'm more interested in mock interviews by applied ai as they promised 
Scalar is also providing the same. Every two weeks they are taking interviews of participants.
20/06/22, 12:07 pm - +91 89210 23935: Their feedback for mine wasn't also satisfactory
20/06/22, 12:09 pm - +91 93464 10791: What shall we do captain? ‚úäüèªüòé
20/06/22, 12:10 pm - +91 90324 45343: True üòÄ, it's like we ordered for a biriyani and got plain rice. Now we should be happy atleast with well cooked rice!
20/06/22, 12:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: For now, applied roots is like a dying limb. The interaction is less between students and applied roots. If there is less questions asked, less thing demanded, then less staffs needed. They will pull staffs to scaler where people will be provided with more mentorship. Even in our live classes roughly 90 - 150 people are joining. When scaler conducts a session 800+ minimum students will join.

Now we need case studies, resume building etc.. if we demand them and if more people demand, they have to allocate more resources to applied roots
20/06/22, 12:17 pm - +91 89210 23935: We have 600+ students right?
20/06/22, 12:20 pm - +91 96310 97922: Guys phase 1 submission for project is 26th right??
20/06/22, 12:20 pm - +91 73825 54571: Can anyone suggest best channel for sql

20/06/22, 12:38 pm - +91 99451 11649: positive thinking is always good. But issue could be like Appliedroots would have promised and shared with UOH as part of the course. if they appliedroots is not compliant to what they mentioned in the course brochure UOH wont provide support and also they dont want to degrade their standards.  May be UOH is not happy with this merger during middle of the course

20/06/22, 1:01 pm - +91 99451 11649: just rough calculation,  for 80K fee we would have around 2000 people around India (95%). only change is acquired  by Scaler. But fee is 3 times more.  How come 30K people?
20/06/22, 1:03 pm - +91 76768 04398: I think we are giving way too much attention to scaler than we are supposed to.
20/06/22, 1:28 pm - +91 88988 90243: Anyone from TCS here?
Do you know how we can change teams or domains?
20/06/22, 1:30 pm - +91 81237 97950: Ex TCS er here, it is possible when you are on bench.
20/06/22, 1:35 pm - +91 88988 90243: I have taken interviews for people who are currently working on some projects but are expected to get released in few days
20/06/22, 1:35 pm - +65 8337 3637: Same, ex TCSer
Apart from being on bench You need a tough push from your target team.. an MD or someone..warna almost impossible
20/06/22, 1:36 pm - +65 8337 3637: Even on my exit discussion they couldn't give me a change of domain üòÖ
20/06/22, 1:36 pm - +91 88988 90243: I want to shift from analytical and insights to R & D team
20/06/22, 1:37 pm - +91 81237 97950: You need to get release from the existing project then and see if you can do that.

21/06/22, 9:26 am - +91 88988 90243: Assignment 30 marks each subject?? Or it was 10 each subject?
21/06/22, 9:27 am - Raghuram Bhumireddy Uoh Project: not assignment those are mid exam marks
21/06/22, 9:27 am - Raghuram Bhumireddy Uoh Project: for assignment 10 marks for each subject
21/06/22, 9:27 am - +91 88988 90243: Columns swapped?

21/06/22, 9:30 am - +91 95811 24141: They mentioned contact program and not assignment or internal, as the brochure said that the 10 marks will be assignments + attendance.

That's a different thing, that they completely forgot about the promised live classes each weekend üòÜ
21/06/22, 10:12 am - +91 98209 18938: This is not UOH standard.. marksheet template

21/06/22, 10:38 am - +91 99451 11649: One of the option could be instead of waiting for the results from UOH, Applied roots can provide their marksheets and results. which can be used for some kind of course certification and used for interviews etc.... anyviews on this
21/06/22, 10:40 am - +91 97411 84635: yes this is good idea
21/06/22, 10:46 am - +91 78599 97820: Applied ai has updated the result

21/06/22, 1:00 pm - +91 99451 11649: I dont see we can comment on Marks list. as long as it comes from UOH and u have valid student number.
21/06/22, 1:23 pm - +91 87469 85667: Actually no one has received marklist from UoH
21/06/22, 1:23 pm - +91 87469 85667: It's just marks memo with UoH logo printed

21/06/22, 1:34 pm - +91 72648 49874: i agree with you, but partially. I am enrolled in Great Lakes program in parallel for AI ML, and it seems, that's the best decision I took (of course with Company funding!), since their teaching methodology is much better focused on real world problems (with adequate mathematics) as well as tons of projects!
21/06/22, 1:34 pm - +91 98209 18938: I was expecting this type of template
21/06/22, 1:39 pm - +91 95000 51421: Right now,  I am more concerned about whether we will get our marks
21/06/22, 1:50 pm - +91 89210 23935: I have 7 marklist from btech with hologram, stamp and watermark on quality paper (not A4 bit long). I studied in ihrd college. It's not about how good it looks, it's about authenticity which is not easily reproducible.
I hope we will get combined marksheet along with certificate with proper standards at the end of diploma.
21/06/22, 1:54 pm - +91 76768 04398: How much are they charging?

21/06/22, 1:57 pm - +91 94529 09216: I think we all should mail this
21/06/22, 1:57 pm - +91 94529 09216: Then only they will think about it
21/06/22, 2:00 pm - +91 72648 49874: Around ‚Çπ2lac INR. But I have it funded by my organization üëç
21/06/22, 2:05 pm - +91 96184 80572: I have also dropped a msg to Srinivas reddy of appliedai whose the coordinator of this course from applied roots team. Hopefully they will consider our request
21/06/22, 2:05 pm - +91 96184 80572: Who is*
21/06/22, 2:07 pm - +91 75690 61914: How is it different from scalar n appliedai ? Can you explain in detail
21/06/22, 2:15 pm - +91 70877 58526: I have seen their YouTube series and it's amazing in explaining concepts.
21/06/22, 2:35 pm - +91 96184 80572: He has replied that they would conduct a live session soon.
21/06/22, 2:50 pm - +91 91762 75222: Super

21/06/22, 5:16 pm - +91 72648 49874: It is different in terms of quality of videos, course content (which is much more targeted and compact, rather than trying to make you a master of everything), contains clear explanations, every week LIVE sessions in the weekend, interesting projects after every Module, and a very helpful support team.
21/06/22, 5:22 pm - +91 77748 96465: But 2lacs is not affordable for majority of crowd while most ppl could afford applied ai
21/06/22, 5:22 pm - +91 77748 96465: Sounds interestingüòÅ
21/06/22, 5:26 pm - +91 91131 88923: Entire fees company is paying? 
Our company is providing Upgrad courses with 18% discount. We need pay full fees.
21/06/22, 5:31 pm - +91 72648 49874: Then we get similar quality as we are seeing now. üòéüòÇ
21/06/22, 5:32 pm - +91 72648 49874: I completely agree about the cost
21/06/22, 5:33 pm - +91 77748 96465: I think spending 30k and getting this much is better thn spending another 1.7lacs
I'm saying with respect to affordability
21/06/22, 5:33 pm - +91 72648 49874: Whomsoever can afford may go on. I was not debating about cost. My concern was quality and support üëç
21/06/22, 5:34 pm - +91 99451 11649: U means Great lakes is good..
21/06/22, 5:34 pm - +91 99451 11649: U mean*
21/06/22, 5:36 pm - +91 72648 49874: Definitely yes.
21/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 88886 52319: I enrolled back then with PadhaAi and experienced  good quality and clarity in content as compare to Applied roots, and fees is 1000 Rs only !

21/06/22, 6:50 pm - +91 74062 88886: Guys what about IISc Deep Learning course? organised by Talent Sprint. This entire course would be taught live by IISc professors.
21/06/22, 7:00 pm - +91 89210 23935: What I mean is, this is something I personally feel, at this stage the focus should be on building GitHub/portfolio, completing projects and giving interviews for those who are NOT already in the data science field.
21/06/22, 7:17 pm - +91 95000 51421: Yeah  I agree.  Otherwise,  it is going to be a repeat learning of the same thing for another year.
21/06/22, 7:19 pm - +91 95000 51421: If there is going to be a delay in getting the mark sheet from UoH,  how can we justify /prove in resume or interview that we have completed this degree. Any ideas pls
21/06/22, 7:19 pm - +91 89210 23935: Yeah python, stats, linear regression, zzzz..
21/06/22, 7:20 pm - +91 89210 23935: It's like we already developed the skeleton, build on top of that
21/06/22, 7:44 pm - +91 88988 90243: Mail. Is sufficient
21/06/22, 7:44 pm - +91 72648 49874: I agree. That's why I said that it is only for comparison and information and not for reenrollment
22/06/22, 4:33 pm - +91 88605 79404: Hi guyz... I am transitioning to ml..

This is a silly qn...

What is pytorch...is it just a library like Keras to implement deep learning...do it has some advantages...
n do we need to know all Keras pytorch tensorflow
22/06/22, 4:37 pm - +91 91131 88923: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ujjyainimitra_fullstackdatascientist-ai-ml-activity-6944935334895853568-kjnH?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app
22/06/22, 4:48 pm - +91 89210 23935: Both are deep learning libraries. TF was developed by Google, pytorch by facebook
22/06/22, 4:51 pm - +91 95811 24141: Adding: Keras is built on top of Tensorflow
22/06/22, 4:51 pm - +91 83329 81498: Pytorch is another deep learning framework that is developed by researchers at meta similar to how Google develops tensorflow. Both libraries perform the same thing but differently. They are essentially built to perform large scale differentiation utilising the computational power of modern day GPUs. The way they approach this is different. However their approaches can now be replicated in each library. Also tensorflow is more helpful when you're trying to build an end to end dl application because of its better support for tinyml. Pytorch is much more useful than tensorflow when it comes to quickly prototyping models for research because of how easier it is. Pytorch is slowly overtaking tensorflow these days but both have their uses.
22/06/22, 4:54 pm - +91 88605 79404: Keras seems easy to code than tensorflow...
22/06/22, 4:59 pm - +91 89210 23935: Keras is made on top of tensorflow like how seaborn is made in top of matplotlib. 
Keras was added to the tensorflow library later, you can call keras using tf.keras.layers
Yeah keras is simple, you can add each layers with one line of code. Never used pytorch but it is seen often in GitHub.
22/06/22, 4:59 pm - +91 88885 88053: Keras is API of Tensorflow, underneath it uses Tensorflow

25/06/22, 5:03 pm - +91 70627 99435: i also had the same question but this 2 yrs validity is only for course access not the curriculum
25/06/22, 5:05 pm - +91 70627 99435: i am from batch 1 only
25/06/22, 5:06 pm - +91 78935 55163: No bro, sir said we have 2 yr to complete program, I still remember sir telling for metch we have 2yr duration for that University will provide 4yr time to complete, similarly ours is 1 yr then there should 2 yr to complete.
25/06/22, 5:06 pm - +91 78935 55163: For batch 1, this is last chance right, this is second yr for batch1

25/06/22, 5:09 pm - +91 70627 99435: when i joined batch1 after few months i joined other company as data scientist, so i dont know about placements because i did not completed second sem yet

25/06/22, 5:15 pm - +91 70627 99435: right thats the problem
25/06/22, 5:19 pm - +91 78935 55163: Now wondering, what happens if somone didn't get through with project, or they pass everyone with passing mark to get way with this batch?

25/06/22, 5:42 pm - +91 70627 99435: defer is a different name, its similar the way student failed and appear in next year. I was marked failed in batch1
25/06/22, 5:43 pm - +91 97018 27354: In every uni if one fails enough subjects, they get year deferrals. Call whatever you want, but you get behind your batch mates.
25/06/22, 5:44 pm - +91 89210 23935: Hey, what is your project?
25/06/22, 5:44 pm - +91 97018 27354: Thing is aaic wants to get it over with the diploma prog.
25/06/22, 5:46 pm - +91 97018 27354: Anyways in Jan Parliament session, edu ministry enacted a law to prevent unis to collaborate with pvt entities.
25/06/22, 5:47 pm - +91 89210 23935: Anyone got clustering as their project?
25/06/22, 5:47 pm - +91 97018 27354: Hope we get a diploma.
25/06/22, 5:48 pm - +91 88605 79404: Yeh kab hua
25/06/22, 5:48 pm - +91 88605 79404: Bhai degree denge ya nai yeh humein
25/06/22, 5:49 pm - +91 97018 27354: End of Jan, I think 27 or 29 Jan.
25/06/22, 5:56 pm - +91 97018 27354: Not sure brother, but aaic has been dodging these ques. Many universities are giving 1 year PG diplomas. But they switched from pg to just diploma citing the reason ugc says pgd has to be 2 years. Centrally funded unis are giving 1yr pgd just fine.
25/06/22, 5:57 pm - +91 97018 27354: I paid 1st sem fees before and later learned they made it a diploma. I was not through enough before paying.
25/06/22, 6:04 pm - +91 88605 79404: Don't u think people should file a legal case on them... I mean before enrolling students they said it is pg diploma.... Now it's not
25/06/22, 6:04 pm - +91 88605 79404: Was it a simple tactic to get more enrollments
25/06/22, 6:05 pm - +91 97018 27354: Who has time?
25/06/22, 6:07 pm - +91 99125 51007: friends, anyone has info about project 35 group?
25/06/22, 6:10 pm - +91 75690 61914: I'm not sure when you guys had enrolled but when I enrolled, I was told it is diploma only not pg diploma.
25/06/22, 6:10 pm - +91 75690 61914: I called them and enquired clearly they told me it was diploma only
25/06/22, 6:11 pm - +91 97018 27354: In early Aug.

25/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 75690 61914: Correct actually it was pgd only, there was a video by csk on YouTube saying it's pgd but later UoH denied itseems so they told me it was only diploma
25/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 97018 27354: Anyways, I should have cleared this before paying. I just hope we get a cert.
25/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 88988 90243: Email id was created first and they cleared after fewer months that they can't give due to some changed circular
Email id is same and not changed
25/06/22, 6:18 pm - +91 99125 51007: It is diploma only, but they said trying to get for MS
25/06/22, 6:19 pm - +91 97018 27354: Yes, he said something abt pgd ugc 2 years.
25/06/22, 6:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: They said we have 2 years to complete it
25/06/22, 6:20 pm - +91 97018 27354: But there are universities in India giving 1 year pgd. It's just their prog maybe didn't quality. Saying ugc 2 years, was the req was not true at all.
25/06/22, 6:20 pm - +91 75690 61914: Yes later they sold to scalar from there we all know what happened
25/06/22, 6:31 pm - +91 97018 27354: I'm just doing the bare min to finish this. At this point this has become a distraction. I have made a list of ppl I follow in dl/ml community and had some success in talking with them. It has made me realize that the req for ml eng(not ds) roles is quite high, so learning from other resources as well. DL part of our course is not that strong.
25/06/22, 6:41 pm - +91 91762 75222: Why DL part is not strong
25/06/22, 6:41 pm - +91 91762 75222: What more we require to know complete DL
25/06/22, 7:18 pm - +91 94529 09216: It is true most of us are facing difficulties with DL, but one good thing with dl, is that our machine learning concepts are now more clearer because of DL
25/06/22, 7:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: And if you are facing issues with DL, it's completely ok
25/06/22, 7:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: It will take time
25/06/22, 7:19 pm - +91 94529 09216: And we have to accept it
25/06/22, 7:20 pm - +91 94529 09216: Kabhi to mai bhi sochata hu, yar band Karo dl, Jo ml padha h ,usi ko acche se revise kar ke nayi job ke liye apply karte h
25/06/22, 7:21 pm - +91 77748 96465: For CNN if you ask me ...go through our content once...and then follow Andrew Ng's lectures
25/06/22, 7:21 pm - +91 77748 96465: MLPs  RNN LSTM are covered fairly well in our course
25/06/22, 7:22 pm - +91 94529 09216: üëç
25/06/22, 7:39 pm - +91 72648 49874: This is so true. Lot of engineering and containerization principles including Cloud and devops is needed .
25/06/22, 7:47 pm - +91 77748 96465: I have seen interviews of some faang ppl....
Those ppl said fundamental concepts of ML and DL including maths stats and programming is sufficient for most of the roles...
I'm not sure if that's enough
25/06/22, 7:55 pm - +91 97018 27354: I don‚Äôt know how to answer to that.
Are you able to replicate papers circa 2019 onwards?
Follow CVPR/ACL papers/workshops, if you are able to reproduce some of it then you know some DL. That is what is the min. req. for entry positions. Actually, min. is publications at these events and advanced degrees. Trivial textbook problems on your portfolio are not that helpful(almost every resume will have some version of these).

25/06/22, 7:57 pm - +91 97018 27354: It is my personal ambition/goal(+ challenging work is one of the ingredients of an interesting life). I get only rejections, even thought I have a MS(which I feel is now rendered useless by youngsters with multiple publications under their belt).
25/06/22, 7:57 pm - +91 97018 27354: There are many startups whose total funding is less than what bigger corporations spend for experiments and training a single model.
25/06/22, 7:57 pm - +91 97018 27354: On the OPS side some startups are focusing on pruning, lower precision approximations, hardware and/or compiler optimizations in some vertical, and to get jobs at these interesting companies is also hard.
25/06/22, 7:58 pm - +91 97018 27354: Sorry, I honestly don‚Äôt know how to answer to your question, I guess you have to sample out what is out there to compare.
25/06/22, 8:01 pm - +91 97018 27354: *daily/weekly/monthly
25/06/22, 8:02 pm - +91 97018 27354: *though(not thought; stupid auto correct)
25/06/22, 8:02 pm - +91 91762 75222: Start small like try to build unet, classification models... Then slowly improve to implement some what tough models

26/06/22, 8:19 am - +91 72648 49874: In case of MAANG or FAANG companies you are right. I can confirm this since I was lucky to clear one recently üòä. The only ML question I was asked is to implement something similar to KNN classifier Live without an IDE during one roind of interview, while the rest was SQL and System design. üëç

26/06/22, 11:05 am - +91 89210 23935: Hi NavEEEn.
The WhatsApp group was created by @917870581961 when we were on slack. Then lot of people spread the message at different times and that's how the group grew. I'm not aware of any organizer in the group, credits should be given to people who helps others by resolving their queries, sharing knowledge and opportunities like the above job posting by @919537026661.
It is a great source of learning, clearing confusions, and giving support, especially during the exams.  Personally I feel @919893388933 @917982651740 @918898890243 are always a great help to me and others when it comes to providing support during the exams in the group.

To the new people who joined, we also have a linkedin group.  https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9175253

26/06/22, 5:53 pm - +91 94600 27985: 5-6 pages isn't mandatory. You could have 6 pages of BS and still get 3 marks and 3 pages of concise data and get 5 .
Depends on the mentor.
26/06/22, 6:38 pm - +91 95057 59576: No, they said make the changes and submit along with next phase submission

28/06/22, 11:32 am - +65 8337 3637: Probably because your mentor is a part-timer (I know mine is).

But no suggestions for changes has been said. What is required to be done next?
28/06/22, 4:31 pm - +91 90071 50601: Comment says - Phase 1 submission evaluated. Proceed with phase 2 submissions.
28/06/22, 4:43 pm - +91 87889 73761: It means you mentor has evaluated your assignment for phase -1
28/06/22, 4:43 pm - +91 87889 73761: If there is any changes they will write in comment box
28/06/22, 4:43 pm - +91 90071 50601: Yeah. But it should be done, after evaluation, if there are no further changes required to be made.
28/06/22, 4:43 pm - +91 90071 50601: Yeah in comment this was only written.
28/06/22, 4:44 pm - +91 87889 73761: No....they said it will be done at the end of project...i.e. your phase -6

28/06/22, 7:14 pm - +91 73825 54571: Still no
28/06/22, 10:22 pm - +91 70090 20949: Has anybody mailed for semester results as well?

28/06/22, 10:24 pm - +91 96184 80572: I really don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt come for a live session and atleast ask our queries
28/06/22, 10:26 pm - +91 70090 20949: Right no live session from a long time
28/06/22, 10:26 pm - +91 70090 20949: Earlier it used to be almost every weekend
28/06/22, 10:26 pm - +91 98315 06503: Can you show the reply? No need to panic- mail?
28/06/22, 10:27 pm - +91 96184 80572: <Media omitted>
28/06/22, 10:32 pm - +91 98315 06503: Let's just do our work. We can see later if they give placements or not. If we don't study then no point in them scheduling interviews.
28/06/22, 10:32 pm - +91 98315 06503: Just trust them for now
28/06/22, 10:32 pm - +91 96184 80572: True but the least they could do is give results
28/06/22, 10:33 pm - +91 94529 09216: Seems like something is wrong between appliedroots and UoH
28/06/22, 10:33 pm - +91 96184 80572: Yes
28/06/22, 10:34 pm - +91 94529 09216: No one can do manual scrutiny of our exam videos, and i guess no one is doing that
 But still they didn't declared the result
28/06/22, 10:35 pm - +91 94529 09216: Yet
28/06/22, 10:36 pm - +91 77748 96465: So if sem 2 results also gets delayed by 3 months...we might have placement assistance in 2023
28/06/22, 10:36 pm - +91 77748 96465: We should start looking for jobs ourselves rather than depending on them
28/06/22, 10:38 pm - +91 96184 80572: Exactly the more delay in results the more delay there would be in our placements..if not placement assistance from applied team I‚Äôm not sure how helpful doing diploma would be without a certificate during interviews
29/06/22, 1:42 am - +91 91824 44341: I agree with you...


As per the words from Testimonials‚úçüèª
I understood that the course completion itself can boost our profile and confidence to crack a Job.
29/06/22, 1:43 am - +91 91824 44341: Just like any early age startup...

10/07/22, 11:43 am - +91 94529 09216: Are please don't do that, lstm, auto encoder, entity encoding these are real Machine learning stuffs
10/07/22, 12:43 pm - +91 88605 79404: personally i feel... these guyz have enrolled students from various domains promising easy transition to applied ai careers.... but they are not doing that effort for those... obviously people who hv studied some sort of cs or statistics would find it easy to learn from videos...                                          all this time i see ads of scalar academy doing session.. there is a session of scalar today at 7 from srikant sir... atleast hv a session every week fr problem solving...   for those guyz who r new to this field..its a total loss of money..
10/07/22, 1:07 pm - +91 94529 09216: Totally agree, I am just saying, instead of getting demotivated, we can do what is in our hands
10/07/22, 1:08 pm - +91 94529 09216: Rest what applied team will do, we can't control that
10/07/22, 1:22 pm - +91 76768 04398: Knowing statistics and Mathematics is good but the main part is coding. I just want to clarify that
10/07/22, 1:26 pm - +91 88605 79404: yeah i understand... also we wasted a lot of time on dynamic programming n stuff... i feel there is no use of studying all that n giving away 2 months to that
10/07/22, 1:27 pm - +91 76768 04398: Yep
10/07/22, 1:28 pm - +91 88605 79404: there was no use of having live sessions on dyanmic programming , recursions when we r not having live sessions on cnn rnn lstm

15/07/22, 12:28 pm - +91 88605 79404: Someone was saying that batch 1 students HV been placed
15/07/22, 5:19 pm - +91 96433 93292: I have a doubt which confuses me a lot : 

Should we perform outlier treatment on whole data or train data only 

And missing value treatment
15/07/22, 5:20 pm - +91 96433 93292: Can someone can explain the right logic
15/07/22, 5:22 pm - +91 98666 19981: I think missing value treatment on the whole data. But outliers treatment we have to on the train data not on test. Coz once you put your model into production the real world data will have outliers. So in my view test and real world data should almost be similar. Correct me if my assumption is wrong.
15/07/22, 5:29 pm - +91 94529 09216: Agree
15/07/22, 5:31 pm - +91 96433 93292: If we are replacing missing with mean/mode what is the right approach

1 * replace it with mean training set 

2 * replace it with mean of whole data set 

3 * calculate different mean/mode for train and test data separatly
15/07/22, 5:32 pm - +91 88605 79404: Mean of only training data .... Never ever touch yr test data till u get to the stage of predictions
15/07/22, 5:33 pm - +91 98666 19981: Basically model should never see the face of test data
15/07/22, 5:33 pm - +91 98666 19981: So never include any sort of measures that calculated using test.
15/07/22, 5:36 pm - +91 96433 93292: As we should not touch test data that means we should not perform missing imputation and outlier treatment on test data ....am i wrong or right ?
15/07/22, 5:44 pm - +91 98666 19981: We do missing imputation for test but using only test data.
15/07/22, 5:46 pm - +91 96433 93292: You mean calculate mean/median of test data saparately to impute missings in test data
15/07/22, 5:48 pm - +91 98666 19981: Yes that is what I think is the right way.
15/07/22, 6:01 pm - +91 95811 24141: Nopes. What if a particular feature has missing data for all the observations in test. Will you put "0" for all test observations?

Calculation of mean, median etc. Is done only in train,and used in both train and test

16/07/22, 11:21 am - +91 88855 50259: You could do PCA to reduce it to 2 or 3 dimensions. But more importantly, it depends on how sparse your feature space is. If most of the features are sparse, or known to be unimportant, or one hot encoded, you can opt different methods.
16/07/22, 11:40 am - +91 70018 23701: Check for ways to feature importance'
16/07/22, 1:06 pm - +91 96310 97922: Do we need to perform data pre processing in this phase only ??

17/07/22, 5:55 pm - +91 91131 88923: I think we can select the important features by using information gain or Pearson correlation.
Do the univariate and bivariate analysis on those features.
I may be wrong but applied this technique for my project.

17/07/22, 10:38 pm - +91 91630 67859: just seen the video...we need to resubmit it
17/07/22, 10:39 pm - +91 87587 85027: You will have to wait until the first one gets evaluated and re open for resubmission... If you got the comment from mentor then I think you can request Applied Roots to open for resubmission.
17/07/22, 10:39 pm - +91 88844 76831: but the first phase is still showing as pending with no comments added...
17/07/22, 10:41 pm - +91 87587 85027: Then mail Mentor and applied root in cc to get it evaluated or wait for mentor to complete his/her part. Either way you can reach out to Mentors email.
17/07/22, 10:41 pm - +91 88844 76831: Okay thank you....

17/07/22, 11:47 pm - +91 73825 54571: Its evaluated
17/07/22, 11:48 pm - +91 90071 50601: Then you can resubmit. Mine is in created state, although there's a comment that "it has been evaluated, proceed to phase 2"

18/07/22, 8:41 pm - +91 89783 80243: Yesterday I have sent a mail to them and got this reply
18/07/22, 8:42 pm - +91 79080 85397: That mean we can submit our phases 2 document before 20 ?
18/07/22, 8:45 pm - +91 89783 80243: As per the reply, it is ok.
I think for our comfort they have created deadlines,so that we cannot overburden. It is not that if we didn't submit we will miss the marks.. ultimately we have to do our own project.
18/07/22, 8:46 pm - +91 79080 85397: Ok .thanks buddy .

21/07/22, 11:09 pm - +91 88855 99774: Only training should be balanced
21/07/22, 11:11 pm - +91 88855 99774: If you want to make the data balance first make it and then do splitting
21/07/22, 11:12 pm - +91 83449 80933: kk
22/07/22, 1:38 am - +91 99451 11649: Usually..after splitting only train data set should be balanced( i.e either 80% or 70%). Rest for cross validation. Usually cross validation used as it is for testing. This is the usual practice.

23/07/22, 1:14 pm - +91 90324 45343: Hi Folks,

We would like to start by apologizing for the fact that the results are taking way longer than what would have been desirable. We have been given more information from the university about why there is a delay so you can all better understand the situation.

According to the New Education Policy (NEP) all collegiate programs that started after 2020 need to be recorded in the National Academic Dashboard (NAR) to facilitate credits transfer, if applicable, later. As you know, the Diploma Program in AI & ML is recognized by UGC as well as WES worldwide. Since the program was started in February 2021, we are now liable to record our program and all its subjects in NAR so later on you can transfer these credits to another educational institution and get more credits to get your Master's degree. Right now, this is not possible but we are working towards facilitating this in the future so you can choose to do it, if you prefer. This work has taken longer than we initially expected and that is the primary reason for the delay in declaring the results.

However, we are in the very final stage of declaring the results and would like to inform you that you can expect it in the next 14 days. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this delay may have caused you and hope that you now have a better understanding of the situation.

P.S. For those from the February 2021 batch who still haven't received their Semester 1 Marksheet, we are planning to send both Semester 1 and Semester 2 together after the results are declared. So, if you haven't received the same yet, we request your patience and understanding in the matter.


Thanks,
Applied Roots Team
23/07/22, 1:16 pm - +91 88605 79404: Means we can convert our diploma to masters if we want?
23/07/22, 1:17 pm - +91 93464 10791: No, you can get few credits in your masters waived. Few courses can be taken off your masters.
23/07/22, 2:21 pm - +91 99451 11649: Seems, There is a reason to send this. Some people have  sent mails to UOH and UGC
23/07/22, 2:21 pm - +91 99451 11649: Anyway hope we will get results as per latest deadline
23/07/22, 2:32 pm - +91 94529 09216: Any idea whether last batch had got their results or not
23/07/22, 2:32 pm - +91 94529 09216: And what's the condition of their placement
23/07/22, 2:34 pm - +91 95811 24141: Batch 1 second sem results not yet declared.
23/07/22, 2:35 pm - +91 95811 24141: Only God can answer this.

24/07/22, 12:34 pm - +91 72648 49874: Basically any feature can be encoded in many ways. Few which we have learnt in our program are Label and One Hot encoding. Then there is frequency based encoding, representation of image data as numbers, scaling the matrix of RGB values of any image/video, etc. Each have their pros and cons, and if we start writing about it, then we'll end up writing a complete book üôÇ Instead, one can take some of these examples from Google/Internet and write couple of lines about them.

24/07/22, 4:10 pm - +91 88605 79404: Guyz just a basic qn...if a person wants to crack NLP engineer , data scientist or a machine learning enginner...the focus should be more on models like bert n transformer...rather than models unets or yolo... That would be more specific to computer vision engineer

bcoz unets yolo are barely explained in videos..just basic..no coding..

24/07/22, 8:07 pm - +91 72648 49874: That may also depend on the company for which the interview is given and the role?
24/07/22, 8:22 pm - +91 88605 79404: That's what I m asking...in general as a data scientist or machine learning engineer, how many companies look fr candidates with these types of algos-yolo n unet... 
Bcoz what I feel in course they hv given only basic knowledge... So either we can go other sources or not
24/07/22, 8:39 pm - +91 98933 88933: Unless a company specializes in CV I don't think it's required
24/07/22, 9:24 pm - +91 91824 44341: What is the last date to submit the phase 3
Documentation.

If I'm planning to submit Phase2 Along with phase 3
24/07/22, 9:34 pm - +91 93464 10791: I think we can take few more months since the course is highly accredited. Let's collectively apologize for the delay from our end to UoH and Applied Roots team.

25/07/22, 10:19 am - +91 72648 49874: In my view it is only thise companies who are exploring or have at least some projects in CNN areas. Like some financial institutions, or Analytics Bouquets like Brillio or Tiger Analytics, etc.

Interestingly in MAANG it seems they ask only basic questions. For example I was asked to only code a KNN classifier from scratch even if there are projects in my team on CNN.

How can I convert Big O notations to time?
27/07/22, 4:00 pm - +91 77108 91776: Big O notations to hrs or seconds
27/07/22, 8:19 pm - +91 74061 90889: Is there a min mark to score in mid-sem
27/07/22, 8:26 pm - +91 89776 69876: of course but they didn't give the results yet
27/07/22, 8:36 pm - +91 77108 91776: ........
27/07/22, 8:40 pm - +91 96310 97922: I belive we cant ... asympotic notations just gives us how the execution time / space will vary wrt to the input size . In order to get the total execution time   , we will have to get execution time of each line in the code multiplied by number of times it runs.
27/07/22, 8:42 pm - +91 88605 79404: Yes we can't.... Big O is like the max time it can take...

And any suggestion for converting entire datetime from str to numeric?
31/07/22, 6:47 am - +91 90104 97513: Hi to all.this is my first msg in group.
I joined for thus course in Aug 2021.but due to some difficult situations I was not able to concentrate on my studies.i gave exams but I don't think the results wl be fine.
Wl they allow to give exam again with new batch as in course specified that we can complete upto 2023.
And access for study materials wl be also upto 2023.
I got doubt as he?said it's last batch and we are merged with scaler now.
What shall I do?

01/08/22, 8:39 pm - +91 89210 23935: If anyone with no experience in data science wants to make career transition, what should they do? Especially when all the edtechs are promising better careers.

Today my friend called me and asked about Skill slash academy. He was sooo excited to talk about enrolment. One thing is if I say beware of edtechs, don't enrol, he will never learn data science from YouTube or any other sources. He needs that push as well, so he need to join somewhere which provides good assistance, especially when things gets stuck. But the cost of enrolment is very high.

One of the motivation is better salary, but I know him personally, very talented and willing to put effort in learning but needs assistance.

He can pay money, but need good resources. He is considering scaler and skill slash because of the live classes and job guarantee and referal. 

I paused the hasty enrolment from his part and told him to wait.

Apart from the cost, I think scaler is good in terms of support, and it is his priority as well.
If you guys know any good courses that provides assistance, please share them.
01/08/22, 8:41 pm - +91 79080 85397: You can teach
01/08/22, 8:42 pm - +91 79080 85397: Because you already know that edtech is not going to give placement
01/08/22, 8:42 pm - +91 79080 85397: And charging more money
01/08/22, 8:42 pm - +91 79080 85397: Simply you teach .
01/08/22, 8:42 pm - +91 79080 85397: Your skills will also improve ..
01/08/22, 8:43 pm - +91 83449 80933: Bangalore right
01/08/22, 8:44 pm - +91 79080 85397: Because if I am getting a private tutor in less cost then I will go for it.. because for data science getting a job is very difficult.
01/08/22, 8:55 pm - +91 88605 79404: No use of scalar fr 3 lakh...waste of money
01/08/22, 8:56 pm - +91 77748 96465: Those who are freshers...in this batch ...what u guys are planning to do considering current placement scenario of applied roots?
01/08/22, 8:57 pm - +91 93464 10791: I heard from some people great lakes is good. But don't know how much it would cost.

01/08/22, 9:17 pm - +91 89715 68712: Great lakes is good if the person is completely from different background, because i see lot of people in my company from great lakes. It's very commercial atleast to get 100% placement, they will somehow push and make the candidate get a entry level job.
01/08/22, 9:24 pm - +91 83449 80933: Will ask them for more interviews
01/08/22, 9:25 pm - +91 89210 23935: Thank you everyone!! üôè
01/08/22, 9:44 pm - +91 96201 02221: It might be good, not sure. And its not far to make a general comment without knowing the teacher. It may be worse or the best :) 
But if anyone wish to learn from a very good teacher(just like Srikant Sir), I would surely recommend Prof Pratyush and Prof Mitesh (I have not seen any profession who is as humble as Mitesh Sir) 

These course are 1000, which may be very much affordable.  

https://padhai.onefourthlabs.in/

And if anyone is interested to learn Python/Numpy/Pandas at a deep level they can refer to Fred Baptis course (I guess it would be around 30USD or so) 
https://mathbyteacademy.com/online-courses 

To check his lectures you may see this : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOsGw17tMhM4-GBjvQnXGzQ/videos

To complete these courses, one would need more than 1years, but the teaching quality is way high. 
So, if anyone is looking for just learning and not that interested for job assistance, they may like to look into these.  
Happy Learning :)

02/08/22, 10:00 am - +91 83449 80933: what's difference between np.array() and .toarray() ?
02/08/22, 10:01 am - +91 83449 80933: np.array() works on list and toarray() works on sparse matrix . Is there differnce in between?
02/08/22, 10:13 am - +91 89210 23935: I believe sparse_arr.toarray() converts the matrix to numpy dense arrays. I don't think there is any difference between the datatypes after conversion, please check by using type(arr1), type(arr2). For practical purposes, both behave as ndarrays

05/08/22, 11:52 am - +91 88605 79404: I think stratify depends on output variable y ..rather than whether a feature is discrete or continuous

08/08/22, 7:10 pm - +91 83300 49953: Hi guys, actually had a query. I am working on this project and have created a flask api for my model. But each time, a request is sent, my model gets loaded again. How can i make my model only load once and just call the same for prediction every time?
08/08/22, 7:12 pm - +91 77108 91776: I had no idea about flask. But you know, just a suggestion you can easily deploy your project in django.
08/08/22, 7:18 pm - +91 83300 49953: Ohh, okay. Thanks. Will try.But if anyone else has an idea about flask, please help
08/08/22, 8:22 pm - +91 98933 88933: I think this situation was covered in the flask live session, did u get a chance to watch that
08/08/22, 8:37 pm - +91 88988 90243: For streamlit we use cache
08/08/22, 9:46 pm - +91 89210 23935: Load the model outside the function.
08/08/22, 10:25 pm - +91 98933 88933: yes exactly this was covered in the flask live session
08/08/22, 11:11 pm - +91 83300 49953: Ohh, okay,I'll definitely check it out
08/08/22, 11:11 pm - +91 83300 49953: Thanks a lot guys

You can check this one out..m
11/08/22, 4:23 pm - +91 81431 48249: Use streamlit , its easy and fast
11/08/22, 4:38 pm - +91 77108 91776: Umm, in the app.py it should predict read and predict the model at the same time by uploading CSV file
11/08/22, 4:48 pm - +91 81431 48249: Yes, there are existing components for the same in streamlit

13/08/22, 4:47 pm - +91 77748 96465: Guys...I have a qstn
Consider a case where I have a classification problem. I have train and evaluation dataset...but the train data set only has positive class while evaluation dataset has both positive and negative class...is there any way to solve this prblm?
13/08/22, 4:47 pm - +91 87587 85027: Stratify split
13/08/22, 4:48 pm - +91 88605 79404: Mix both datasets n then.solve imbalanced first... Then do train test split
13/08/22, 4:50 pm - +91 77748 96465: Thanks guys...others also pls tell if you'll have any other way to handle this case
13/08/22, 5:15 pm - +91 77108 91776: Merge the datasets and then perform stratified train test splitting using class label
13/08/22, 9:22 pm - +91 72648 49874: There is no other way as far as generally available. If we mix the data back and oversample the minority class using SMOTE or similar, and then perform the split, then even with Random Split it would give desired results.
13/08/22, 10:54 pm - +91 83088 87324: In train_test_split function if y has more than one column then does it work
13/08/22, 11:04 pm - +91 79080 85397: Yes it will work i think. because in case of multi class classification y has multiple rows like 0000100

some datasets are missing
14/08/22, 10:51 pm - +91 75690 61914: I think we need to pay some price for that
14/08/22, 10:51 pm - +91 88988 90243: i have a subscription but do not see datasets

14/08/22, 10:55 pm - +91 88988 90243: i have downloaded those but can't find few 
Is there any other source where they store data?
14/08/22, 10:57 pm - +91 95811 24141: There are two options:
1. Submit a request with datacamo support about specific dataset query
2. Usually they specify the dataset source for each course, e.g. they say that data taken from Kaggle ... Go to the source and check there
14/08/22, 10:58 pm - +91 88988 90243: Thank you let me try option 1. 2 already tried
15/08/22, 1:39 pm - +91 88988 90243: Hi everyone
Can you suggest a good cloud training? 
It should be from Basic to advanced like our course
15/08/22, 9:05 pm - +91 96201 02221: if you pick AWS as one of the vendor, then you can pick https://learn.cantrill.io/ 
If you pick Azure, you can pick some other class. 
But I would personally recommend AWS, if you dont have any bias, and in any case, you can pick any and stick to that. Learning other platforms(in case you need would be a cake walk)
15/08/22, 9:05 pm - +91 99451 11649: Hi pls share if any one having last year mock test and assignment qn papers

No role of Applied Roots.

16/08/22, 3:27 pm - +91 88988 90243: Hi Dhananjay,

We understand that but we are unable to get the university to work on it as they have been busy with the NAD registration and the semester results. Once they are sorted, we will inform them about this and get them to work on this issue. Please note that the ID card shouldn't stand in your way to complete the program or give any of the exams.

17/08/22, 7:22 pm - +91 95057 59576: Before sem end exam
17/08/22, 7:59 pm - +91 91824 44341: What Iff not...

Course completion will be delayed
Or they'll give the certification with next batch!?
17/08/22, 8:00 pm - +91 70090 20949: Classroom exercises have a weightage in overall semester marks
17/08/22, 8:00 pm - +91 70090 20949: If you are passing without it , no worries
17/08/22, 8:02 pm - +91 91824 44341: No Hopes leftüôÉ

17/08/22, 8:10 pm - +91 95811 24141: If they are not done, some marks will be less. Thats it..
17/08/22, 9:00 pm - +91 88855 50259: What about that non-existent placement support they promised? Wouldn't the assignments matter for that?
17/08/22, 9:12 pm - +91 95811 24141: Dude, your question already has the answer.
17/08/22, 9:13 pm - +91 88855 50259: Yeah, we can mostly guess. Except that nothing is confirmed yet. Neither the placement support nor the influence of the assignments.
17/08/22, 9:15 pm - +91 89210 23935: So basically you don't want to do the assignment
17/08/22, 9:16 pm - +91 88855 50259: Why not?
17/08/22, 9:23 pm - +91 89210 23935: I don't see a direct relationship between assignments and placement. Although I see how assignment influences marks and marks influence placements.
17/08/22, 9:35 pm - +91 73825 54571: Y ppl loosing intrest
17/08/22, 9:37 pm - +91 89210 23935: Extreme negativity is one of the factor
17/08/22, 9:37 pm - +91 73825 54571: Thts wht my doubt is
17/08/22, 9:37 pm - +91 73825 54571: Negativity bcz of our lagging or bcz of appliedroots negligence
17/08/22, 9:38 pm - +91 73825 54571: We hav to questionnourselves
17/08/22, 9:42 pm - +91 88704 19945: Applied roots negligence
17/08/22, 9:42 pm - +91 88704 19945: I mean, it doesn't even look like a serious course anymore
17/08/22, 9:42 pm - +91 88704 19945: We just get excuses every time we ask for updates.
17/08/22, 9:53 pm - +91 77748 96465: Find motivation urslf...don't rely on them for placements...if u have done studies seriously..I'm pretty sure we can find job ourselves...this is not the time to lose interest
17/08/22, 9:57 pm - +91 89210 23935: It's like a fact now. From end of sem 1 itself we expected these. I'm not gonna whine about it for the next two months tho.
I won't be surprised to see people saying "I couldn't do xyz because of abc's negligence" like they have no control over it.
17/08/22, 11:29 pm - +91 78756 85040: Are these certifications really matter for Job search?
17/08/22, 11:31 pm - +91 78756 85040: In the case someone who's not from tech background. (That doesn't mean One should give up)
17/08/22, 11:32 pm - +91 78756 85040: Let me be clear I am talking about myself.
17/08/22, 11:37 pm - +91 91131 88923: Certification  I don't think so but real time experience in data science field matters. Some dummy project from youtube or kaggle will not be helpful.

18/08/22, 1:44 pm - +91 72648 49874: Which experience are you referring to? IT experience or Data science experience? I have a senior at Google who learns every day for one hour to keep him updated with the tech growth in data science! This proves that we'll never get all the experience üòä

18/08/22, 1:53 pm - +91 91131 88923: I think doing some real world project like building a recommendation system which used in every organisation.

For example, there is fast.ai which does a lot of those free/freemium courses which you can essentially take for free (the cost is that they show how to implement things using their libraries, which are actually decent).

20/08/22, 5:44 pm - +91 98666 19981: I was providing training images in batches right which was (4,256,256,3) where 4 is the batch size. So when I provide the test image i have to do it in the same shape instead of (256,256,3) i have to give (1,256,256,3).
20/08/22, 5:46 pm - +91 98666 19981: After reshaping the image to (256, 256,3) adding the below code line helped me to convert the input to (1,256,256,3)

24/08/22, 5:15 pm - +91 96201 02221: This is purely my personal opinion :) 
Everyone has a different learning and career path to data/ml/data science. 
But irrespective of all, based on my experience, AppliedAI(now Scalar) when it comes to teaching quality and practical learning, they are the best I guess. 
And yes any university course might feel like little theoretical in the first place, but they are still very useful(at the end of the day those students only building things which we practice in our industry) 

But when it comes to learning along with working, things are little different, we want to get to the ultimate thing fast, meaning, we need to know fair bit of theory but more on the hands on thing which can make us enabled for the real world sooner, and hence AppliedAI/Scalar/fast.ai are better. And if we as an individual wish to get into one topic more in details we can always do so(internet is our friend). 

Now, lot of us would like to have a degree as well, along with the practical learning, which makes perfect sense, Masters are important. 
But I would not recommend places, like BITS(no offense) but dont spend money like that. 

If you are student of AppliedAI/Scalar(Although they have an masters program now), but if u have been a student of these place, you can check one Masters course from here https://www.wqu.edu/ (I heard they are good, specially few of the faculty) and they are all free. 

If I have to take a rebirth and start, and if I am working, I would still prefer to learn from Srikanth sir (via AppliedAI, Scalar or any hell place, where we get teachers like him) and then peruse masters from places like this where its FREE(just to complement the learning with the degree) . 

At the end of the day, we dont not need any course or degree (trust me when I say this, we hire lot of folks and I myself was never discriminated when compared with folks who are way more qualified in terms of degree)

But Masters degree has its own value(specially in long term), no matter from where you take, but I seriously care about the money we spend after our Bachelors(BSc/Btech/etc.)   

So before you enroll for any program, prioritize the learning part first(faculty and course and fee) and then everything else.

24/08/22, 6:40 pm - +91 88855 50259: Personally, I think that even in terms of teaching, there are better sources than appliedroots/scalar.

Srikant sir actually teaches very slowly, and I do not mean it in a good way.
24/08/22, 6:40 pm - +91 95610 76941: Right. He is overrated
24/08/22, 6:47 pm - +91 96201 02221: Yes surely yes. We have many teachers and mentors like him or even better. For me that person was he. I started ML and all things around Data via his YouTube channel and his class, and I could somehow direct my career in similar direction. 
We just need one such teacher or mentor, it could be he or anyone, as long as we have some mentor and teach we are good doesn‚Äôt matter who that person is üòä

My company Qritrim.com is hiring the data science,  and data science intern, and you will work from office (Chandigarh).
For any queries you can text me.

For Position Requirements, skills and apply for the role visit the  website.

For other roles visit the link
https://www.qritrim.com/careers/
24/08/22, 8:05 pm - +91 88855 50259: There are a ton of youtube channels of varying expertise, and podcasts with field experts that can be used to see which topics to reach.

There is coursera where every teacher is a phd in their relevant subject. If you just want the content, you can audit the course for free. For example, andrew ng's machine learning and deep learning courses were very famous.

There is fast.ai which suman mentioned himself.

There is hugging face, google's free machine learning course, open ai's courses which might or might not be video formatted.

And if you don't mind reading, there is kaggle for practical knowledge, there is towardsdatascience, and several research papers and books by those same people who write papers, and the list goes on and on. I hope none of ua think we are newbies who cannot learn some of these complex resources. But even for such students, there are some basic textbooks and some survey type research papers. And for video format, there is coursera, huggingface, fast.ai and youtube channels like datacamp.

The point is, there are more names than I can exhaustively list out.

Whatever I've learnt is from doing Applied AI Course

Honestly if you ask me the recorded videos content is more than enough for any interview (apart from some topics like Programming and SQL where more in depth knowledge is needed but that can be prepared from outside), if we even understand all of that, it'll be okay

I see people cringing over Scaler acquisition and negligence by AppliedRoots over not conducting live sessions, I agree that they did not conduct separate live sessions for us after the Scaler acquisition as they did during the first term (and also they promised that) but honestly those aren't required, I did whole AAIC without live sessions and only through recorded content and it was more than enough

It's very easy to put blame on others but difficult to find our faults, our end goal is to enhance our knowledge and for that recorded content is more than enough, I can bet no one has gone through all the recorded videos (including optional live sessions) even once, if someone did that diligently, getting a job is not that hard

When I talk to my peers, very few of them have such in depth knowledge of subjects as what we AAIC alumnus have because of Srikanth sir

So, to summarize, instead of cringing and crying over things which are not in our hand, make use of what we have at our hand, this content is very valuable (at least to me), watch it, make notes, ask queries (if team doesn't respond, search on the net, talk to peers, you've to struggle for that, even I did, everyone does), solve assignments, this content is so much that no new content is needed at all, just first we've to finish this diligently
26/08/22, 10:21 pm - +91 89715 68712: I truly agree. I got my job through Applied AI without even completing the course, just with 20 assignment completion i was able to obtain senior analyst position. Trust me guys, just focus on the knowledge and follow those pre recorded videos, it's more than enough.
26/08/22, 10:21 pm - +91 88988 90243: Totally agree
26/08/22, 10:21 pm - +91 88605 79404: Wow...man calm down... I hv said earlier also course content is good for CS IT people... But for those from different fields atleast deserve a session weekly....
26/08/22, 10:22 pm - +91 74061 90889: Sailing in the same boat brother
26/08/22, 10:25 pm - +91 98933 88933: I understand and sorry if it was offensive, didn't mean that, all I meant was we can't expect spoon feeding, we have to find our way ourselves, just complaining won't help (I'm not talking about you, some people here are constantly complaining about this acquisition thing since last 3-4 months)
26/08/22, 10:26 pm - +91 98933 88933: Let me tell you one thing, I never coded in my college days (even though I'm from CS/IT background) , I wasn't serious back then, all coding I learnt is through AAIC
26/08/22, 10:27 pm - +91 98933 88933: so CS/IT background didn't add much to my learning
26/08/22, 10:29 pm - +91 88605 79404: Yeah nothing personal bro... I just hv seen some people here struggling with concepts.... A weekly session would hv  helped them.... Yeah i m also from CS / IT... Personally I feel it would be difficult fr non cs folkes.  Just my view
26/08/22, 10:32 pm - +91 72648 49874: Read from notes. üëç
26/08/22, 10:43 pm - +91 73825 54571: This will work...and do mocks

26/08/22, 10:59 pm - +91 83300 49953: 100 percent agreed. To be honest, I don't think we would even have time for live sessions let alone the course content by itself. It is more than  enough in almost all aspects.
26/08/22, 11:09 pm - +91 6354 062 356: Even I think the same .. course content is at par for ML learning.. if we are able to cover even 70 percent course throughly with assignment.. we can clear the data science job interview easily .. we need to put our time and more than 100 percent efforts first . Even I didn‚Äôt put my 100 percent I know ‚Ä¶so I can‚Äôt complain.
26/08/22, 11:12 pm - +91 91131 88923: I feel like I learnt more from the projects which we are doing as part of diploma.
Most of the concepts were clear from solving the real world use cases rather than just going through the videos.
26/08/22, 11:16 pm - +91 91131 88923: Some important statistical concepts like Pearson correlation, chisquare test can be used for selecting the important features so that our model performance can be increased.
26/08/22, 11:16 pm - +91 91131 88923: When I was learning these concepts I didn't realise that these concepts were so useful.
26/08/22, 11:22 pm - +91 91131 88923: Just try to implement the concepts which you have learned till now in projects this will definitely help us to clear interview.
26/08/22, 11:28 pm - +91 96433 93292: Thanks
26/08/22, 11:54 pm - +91 96565 65366: Is the result published officially? I didn't get any mail

27/08/22, 11:15 am - +91 96433 93292: It means incomplete
27/08/22, 11:16 am - +91 89715 68712: Is Enrollment number same as application number?
27/08/22, 11:16 am - +91 89715 68712: Actually i didn't receive the I'd card in starting, i tried to follow up by no response
27/08/22, 11:17 am - +91 95057 59576: With A grade it shows incomplete ü§î
27/08/22, 11:17 am - +91 96433 93292: A means absent I guess
27/08/22, 11:17 am - +91 96433 93292: In case of INC
27/08/22, 11:18 am - +91 88988 90243: Same here 
You can ask for enrollment id  to team
27/08/22, 11:18 am - +91 99125 51007: But yesterday, they provided marks and diclared as pass
27/08/22, 11:19 am - +91 96433 93292: You are from batch 1 right ??

27/08/22, 11:21 am - +91 70090 20949: Only assignment marks are showing that A means absent in exams
27/08/22, 11:21 am - +91 84948 36428: They are still making adjustments or still upadating..! We need to wait until the official announcement

27/08/22, 11:53 am - +91 72045 68400: This is confusing ! I thought it is declared

27/08/22, 11:55 am - +91 95603 55228: i thought its declared but not officially...may be someone tried to made some changes in url that they shared with batch 1 and got result.. may be some website coding issue...

27/08/22, 6:23 pm - +91 91093 77694: Does anyone has given exam on mobile data?
27/08/22, 6:42 pm - +91 74062 88886: It's better you only read mock tests and give exam. It will help
27/08/22, 7:29 pm - +91 91762 75222: Anyone has Last batch mid term exam paper
27/08/22, 7:30 pm - +91 82371 27097: i think this is the one

Thankyou
27/08/22, 8:44 pm - +91 78428 89792: I have used but in emergency. You might need more data for the final 3 hours exam. Get additional data to be on a safer side.
27/08/22, 9:28 pm - +91 84948 36428: Also, use USB tethering instead of hotspot

27/08/22, 10:50 pm - +91 90003 24850: Hi Folks,

We are receiving a lot of emails and calls about issues that you are facing while checking your results. We wanted to clarify that we have not declared the results yet for the August 2021 batch students. Please note that we will not be responsible for any links that you may get from anywhere else and if it damages your computers in any way if you download something from it. You are all advised to wait until you receive an email from pgduoh@appliedroots.com with instructions and an official link to check your semester results.

We will not be able to help you in any way if you download anything from the internet and want us to help you with any discrepancies that this downloaded file may show you. We would also like to advise that when asking questions about the Diploma program, please only address the PGD team or the Mentor's team if it is an academic question. Do not add Applied AI Course team email in it as they are a completely different team dedicated to a different program and they can't help you in any way with your queries. Let us not crowd their inbox with irrelevant emails. We hope we have made things clear now! We don't have a date for the results yet because we are still waiting to receive verified results from UOH. Once we are ready, we will send all active students an email with the steps to be followed and the link to check the results.
27/08/22, 10:50 pm - +91 90003 24850: Received in slack group
27/08/22, 10:54 pm - +91 87449 23207: So what were the results few of students seeing?
27/08/22, 10:55 pm - +91 91093 77694: They are not the official results.
27/08/22, 11:02 pm - +91 91630 67859: At first they told It is for August batch..now they are telling totally different
27/08/22, 11:02 pm - +91 84948 36428: What do they mean by it damages your computers!? I did download the marksheet.. ! Will it affect!
27/08/22, 11:03 pm - +91 96505 18893: I think they must have uploaded the results but might not got an official approval from UoH for our batch. So they have taken it off from their website. Results will be more or less same. They just need an official go ahead from UoH. Since they have declared for batch 1 we will also get the results soon it is just in the pipeline.
27/08/22, 11:05 pm - +91 84948 36428: Also we did get OTPs from them .. I mean from applied roots ..!
27/08/22, 11:06 pm - +91 96505 18893: Dont worry ‚Ä¶ the link had the appliedroots as the root address so i think it is safe
27/08/22, 11:08 pm - +91 89027 12939: Yes, then  who were sending those otps?
27/08/22, 11:13 pm - +91 96505 18893: Yes our enrolment number and phone numbers are linked only in their/UoH database. So OTP trigger was from their database only.

29/08/22, 6:11 pm - +91 83103 59763: Though course fees are quite big , we will recover course fees just within a month after gets our placement in MAANG

29/08/22, 6:26 pm - +91 88885 88053: Yeah, that's what we thought about AAI PGD COURSE
29/08/22, 6:30 pm - +91 70018 23701: If studied seriously, it's enough.
29/08/22, 6:30 pm - +91 70018 23701: We haven't studied and now we're complaining.

29/08/22, 6:35 pm - +91 83103 59763: https://www.scaler.com/review/

1.7 crore was the highest package offered. So we can expect at least half of it ? Students have got placed in Amazon, Adobe, CISCO, Walmart, Google, Microsoft. So I think its not a bad bet if we are getting top notch disciplined learning
29/08/22, 6:39 pm - +91 99993 77441: But they are overcharging
29/08/22, 6:40 pm - +91 88885 88053: There is no one like srikanth sir, his teaching is crisp and clear, easy to understand. Here I am talking AAIC, Scaler, xgz companies

03/09/22, 7:36 pm - +91 90324 45343: Hi Folks,

All of your patience and understanding towards us is coming to an end today as we gear up to launch the results for the August 2021 batch of the Diploma in AI & ML Program. We would like to once again apologize for what has been a longer than usual delay to get these results. We deeply regret any inconvenience that this delay might have caused you.

As we had informed earlier in our previous email update from the university, the delay has been due to the update of the program in the National Academic Dashboard to facilitate credit transfer, if applicable, later. We are glad to say that that has been finished now by the university. So, now that we are ready to declare the results, let us guide you how you can view it on our website:
03/09/22, 7:39 pm - +91 94529 09216: Result same h

05/09/22, 12:32 pm - +91 88988 90243: Hi Folks,

Now that the results have been announced for the first semester, we are slowly moving towards the next steps of the program. We realize that it has been a year since you gave us your communication address and there is a chance that you may have moved to a new address since then.

Hence, the university wanted us to double check with all of you right now. Please note that the certificates will not be sent now and only be shared after both semesters are completed and the results are declared. However, we will not be giving this option again at that time. So, if you want to change your address, now is your only chance!

You have till 8th September, 6:00 p.m to share your responses. Since sending the certificates is a lengthy process with multiple steps, we will not be able to help you later on if you miss this deadline so please share this form in all official/unofficial groups to make sure it reaches everyone on time.

We suggest using an address that will remain accessible to you for at least one year from now to be on the safe side.

Find the form here: https://forms.gle/g3SLa9PDNaE7Nn5P9


Thanks,
Applied Roots Team

07/09/22, 5:07 pm - +91 88855 99774: Yup just create a new virtual environment, before you push save all packages by doing  
pip freeze > requirements.txt
You won't have any dependency issues this way
07/09/22, 5:08 pm - +91 96433 93292: Is the video

07/09/22, 5:09 pm - +91 88855 99774: Also if you are using Streamlit then you can actually deploy the app in Streamlit cloud
07/09/22, 5:09 pm - +91 88855 99774: That should be more easier
07/09/22, 5:09 pm - +91 96433 93292: Is there any tutorial for app building
07/09/22, 5:10 pm - +91 96433 93292: In course

07/09/22, 5:14 pm - +91 96433 93292: Or we can use flask with AWS
07/09/22, 5:18 pm - +91 88855 99774: You can use anything

10/09/22, 7:35 pm - +91 88855 99774: so basically you will apply transformation on input image and then get output image now you want the transformations again on these output images?
10/09/22, 7:38 pm - +91 98666 19981: Let me tell you in simple way. I have X, y but less data. so I want to increase the data. To do that I want to user Image data generator from keras. If I'm applying a transformation t on X1 then we get X1t. we also need y1t so I need to apply same transformation on y1 also.
10/09/22, 8:56 pm - +91 97785 11888: So is it image segmentation task ? You want to apply same transformation to the mask also ?
10/09/22, 9:29 pm - +91 98666 19981: No it's not segmentation. But yaa i found the solution. Thanks
10/09/22, 10:06 pm - +91 91762 75222: Can you please explain what task are you doing
10/09/22, 10:07 pm - +91 98666 19981: My project is to create a model which takes the input as dark images and gives out an brightened image.
10/09/22, 10:08 pm - +91 91762 75222: Oh nice
10/09/22, 10:08 pm - +91 91762 75222: So how are you able to train with less images
10/09/22, 10:10 pm - +91 98666 19981: I tried but it was not giving me great results. So now iam using image data generator from Keras for data augmentation.
10/09/22, 10:10 pm - +91 91762 75222: Nice...what concepts and model are you using???

12/09/22, 6:12 pm - +91 75690 61914: If any company reimburse the Fee, they simply will not allow you to leave company as soon as you complete the degree. There will be conditions something like you have to stay for 1-2 year from completion of the degree.
12/09/22, 6:34 pm - +91 74062 88886: Nope! This won't be any condition.

12/09/22, 6:35 pm - +91 98041 19164: Guys, those who are looking for change its for them : 

You don't a certificate , no company cares about certificate , you can write in your resume about the diploma 99% of time no one will care about it ( telling it from personally experience) 

So if you are waiting just fot thr certificate , start applying
12/09/22, 6:36 pm - +91 74062 88886: Correct
12/09/22, 6:36 pm - +91 93464 10791: I think they are considering to send for both batches once both batches are finished!
12/09/22, 6:38 pm - +91 98041 19164: If they send again a a4 sheets in 4 fold , i will be very disappointed

12/09/22, 7:09 pm - +91 98041 19164: Like if you write it in your resume, and clear the interview, they never ask for certificate submission
12/09/22, 7:09 pm - +91 88605 79404: Ohk

15/09/22, 12:42 pm - +91 96433 93292: We should perform encoding for categorical variables before train test split or after split ??
15/09/22, 12:42 pm - +91 98041 19164: Nope, that is called data leakage
15/09/22, 12:43 pm - +91 96433 93292: What ??
15/09/22, 12:43 pm - +91 98041 19164: We should perform any endoing after the split
15/09/22, 12:43 pm - +91 96433 93292: Ok
15/09/22, 12:43 pm - +91 88988 90243: Before
15/09/22, 12:43 pm - +91 88988 90243: We will miss on few columns right?
15/09/22, 12:44 pm - +91 96433 93292: So should we divide data into train test and perform separate encodings
15/09/22, 12:44 pm - +91 98041 19164: https://youtu.be/n9jz7G68pVg
15/09/22, 12:50 pm - +91 96505 18893: Preprocessing text before split also causes data leakage?
15/09/22, 12:56 pm - +91 98041 19164: Depends what preprocessing you are doing, if that  processing learns from whole data and apply on each data point then, traing data is impacted by test data as well

But if its stemming, stop words removal then does not matter 

But If ita tf-idf and you consider the whole train test data as a single document, the its kind of data leakage,


Now its not inccorect to do it in small projects or a competition, but in production its not recommend
15/09/22, 12:59 pm - +91 96505 18893: Okay thanks i am doing small things like removing stopwords lemmatisation etc
15/09/22, 12:59 pm - +91 90071 50601: For mandatory assignments, can we not upload the ipynb file to submit the assignment or we need to submit it somewhere specific that has been provided by them?
15/09/22, 1:00 pm - +91 98041 19164: Then it should not be the problem, when you perform encoding, make sure before that you split your data into parts before doing that
15/09/22, 1:35 pm - +91 96433 93292: I have one dataset on which i am trying to perform regression
15/09/22, 1:36 pm - +91 96433 93292: All my independent variables have very low correlation with my dependent variable
15/09/22, 1:36 pm - +91 96433 93292: In that case I cannot perfor linear regression??
15/09/22, 1:36 pm - +91 96433 93292: Can anyone help
15/09/22, 1:39 pm - +91 88605 79404: I don't think..just apply and see the metric..
15/09/22, 1:40 pm - +91 96433 93292: Ok
15/09/22, 1:42 pm - +91 96433 93292: I don't think??
15/09/22, 1:43 pm - +91 96433 93292: Do you think we can apply linear regression on it or not
15/09/22, 1:43 pm - +91 99451 11649: Try variable transformation
15/09/22, 1:43 pm - +91 96433 93292: Do you mean i normalise my x
15/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 99451 11649: Like log x or sqrt or ...
15/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 96433 93292: Ok
15/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 96433 93292: And then check corr
15/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 96433 93292: ?
15/09/22, 1:45 pm - +91 99451 11649: How much regression coefficient value

15/09/22, 1:47 pm - +91 96433 93292: I tried linear regression using stats model
15/09/22, 1:48 pm - +91 96433 93292: Adj R squared value is 0.001
15/09/22, 1:48 pm - +91 96433 93292: Which means it is a dull model

15/09/22, 5:27 pm - +91 88855 99774: I have a time series problem
 How do I decide to use 30 days or 90 days of previous data to predict future 7 days ?
15/09/22, 5:29 pm - +91 94529 09216: What model you are going to use?
15/09/22, 5:32 pm - +91 88855 99774: LSTMs
15/09/22, 7:08 pm - +91 88855 50259: Why not use both and see which performs better?
15/09/22, 7:12 pm - +91 88855 99774: But is there any way we can perform some EDA and then decide ?
15/09/22, 7:12 pm - +91 88855 99774: Not just my model performance?
15/09/22, 7:13 pm - +91 88855 99774: By*
15/09/22, 7:23 pm - +91 88855 50259: Then, one possible way I can think of is correlation between the current value to last k lag terms.
But I think it will depend on what you base your decision on. Do you have a metric or do you do it subjectively on some measure of the model
15/09/22, 7:57 pm - +91 88855 99774: Yeah RMSE
15/09/22, 7:57 pm - +91 88855 99774: But that's after prediction

17/09/22, 1:12 pm - +91 96433 93292: I think they have delayed it itself..As othe student who didn't appear in midterm can appear now and those who didn't submit assignment could submit. They just want to clear us all so that they don't get any mails further after end of this semester
17/09/22, 1:15 pm - +91 99125 51007: fn_plot_PMF which library we need to use?

Those who can do .., submit it, those who cannot do, make use of extended time.
Because in final stage we should be with ymore patience...thats the point here friends..nothing else .don't get demotivated yourself

18/09/22, 8:14 pm - +91 96433 93292: Hey guys , i am solving a multiclass classification problem ...where i have a numeric flag column ...

should i treat it as categorical ? 

Do I need to apply any operation to convert it into categorical ? 

What kind of bivariate analysis i can do with this flag variable and my output column (which is multiclass numeric column) ?
18/09/22, 8:14 pm - +91 96433 93292: Please help
18/09/22, 8:17 pm - +91 89197 62311: Without converting u can use plotly for multi class variare analysis by changing labels
18/09/22, 8:19 pm - +91 96433 93292: Changing labels ??
18/09/22, 8:20 pm - +91 89197 62311: Means assigning meaningful labels as anyhow u need finally into numeric for model
18/09/22, 8:21 pm - +91 96433 93292: Exactly can't i directly encode this variable, or i have to convert it into label
18/09/22, 8:23 pm - +91 88605 79404: The flag column u mean is like true or false?
18/09/22, 8:23 pm - +91 99894 99242: You can use ordinal encoder and enforce some order if needed in place as suggested by others above based on the business
18/09/22, 8:23 pm - +91 96433 93292: As it is multiclass classification problem flag is numeric have 11 variables
18/09/22, 8:24 pm - +91 96433 93292: Hmm
18/09/22, 8:27 pm - +91 88605 79404: But how will u give order... Forcing order is like giving rank.. giving rank 1 and rank11....rather than do one hot encoding
18/09/22, 8:29 pm - +91 99894 99242: Correct,  forcing rank will depend on business rules and correlation with other fields. If the business rules underlying are unknown basic ordinal encoder can be directly applied
18/09/22, 8:30 pm - +91 99894 99242: First please try and use an algorithm like ANOVA or MCA to understand the correlation between target and dependent variables (if business rules are not known)
18/09/22, 8:31 pm - +91 96433 93292: OK

19/09/22, 10:09 pm - +91 99894 99242: 1. You do not need to loop dw and w_vanilla as both are numpy arrays. 
2. Also recalculate loss per data point after the weight update with gradient (call the forward prop function again to calculate updated loss with new weights). These changes should help. Able to get through grader function upto 2 decimal places accuracy
19/09/22, 10:10 pm - +91 87449 23207: Okay will try
19/09/22, 10:10 pm - +91 99894 99242: This is assuming the grader functions for forward prop and backward prop worked correctly for you earlier

We understand that there is a great interest to know what the next steps are now that the results have been announced. We have been working with the university to make sure all of your basic details are correct (Name, Parent name, D.O.B etc.,). All of these were in the previous step.

Now, in the next step, we want you to make sure that your name in the certificate is correct according to your SSC (or SSLC as it may be called in some states). So, use the results portal (link given below) and check your name in the result that comes up and make sure that it matches your SSC(or SSLC)/Intermediate Certificate/Degree Certificate/Legal Name change Certificate. Please note that this will be the very last opportunity for you to inform us if your Name needs correction and if you miss it, you will not be able to change it later!

If you believe that your name needs a correction in the spelling after checking, please do not reply to this email. Send us a separate email with the subject line
"Name Correction - (Your name),(Enrollment ID) August 2021 batch"

In the email do not forget to include a copy of your SSC(or SSLC)/Intermediate Certificate/Degree Certificate/Legal Name change Certificate and a screenshot of the Name you see in our results portal. Please note that we will not be able to change your name if there is no certificate from this list attached.

You have until 5 p.m. tomorrow (22nd September 2022) to send us an email if you need the correction. Once again, due to the various steps involved in the whole process, we will not be able to help you if you miss this deadline no matter how reasonable your excuse may be.

22/09/22, 1:27 pm - +91 89197 62311: Try to reduce the data size and recheck
22/09/22, 1:28 pm - +91 89210 23935: If you already optimized the code and data, and still need more ram, then you can try paper space gradient. They provide 30gb ram. But it has limitations like only 5 gb storage and 6 hours run time per day.
22/09/22, 2:38 pm - +91 96505 18893: Thanks
22/09/22, 2:38 pm - +91 96505 18893: Thanks i will try this ‚Ä¶

22/09/22, 2:49 pm - +91 89210 23935: Spacy is easy. I don't find any performance issue when I use en_core_web_sm, if you are using en_core_web_lg, then it's very heavy.

22/09/22, 3:50 pm - +91 89783 80243: In backpropagation gradient descent with momentum.

They have mentioned as Vt as weighted moving averages of gradients.
And also Vt= gamma*Vt-1 + learning rate*dw difference.

I tried with moving averages method, it is not matching  and also they have given a V array with all zeros.

How to update the weights?.
22/09/22, 3:52 pm - +91 88605 79404: v=gamma*v + learning rate*dw
22/09/22, 3:52 pm - +91 88605 79404: Now update w
22/09/22, 3:52 pm - +91 88605 79404: Using this v
22/09/22, 3:54 pm - +91 89783 80243: But all the v values are array of zeros.
22/09/22, 3:54 pm - +91 88605 79404: This final v won't be all 0

Context filters are applied before Dim or Measure filters in order of operations..
Very useful for Fixed LOD calculations..

26/09/22, 1:42 pm - +91 95603 55228: better to do before splitting...

26/09/22, 7:46 pm - +91 99894 99242: It's preferred before split for following reasons:

1) encoder logic is internal to the packages like sklearn.  There is no guarantee that the same numerical assignment for e.g. In case of ordinal encoding will happen for train and test post split. The number of unique categories vs target data decides the variance 
2) missing value imputations also should be done before split because of the randomness associated with the train-test split. 

These are my thoughts
26/09/22, 8:27 pm - +91 89783 80243: Anyone faced attribute error: pandas none type object unable to split.

Pandas isna and nullsum showing none type is not available.still it is showing error
26/09/22, 8:28 pm - +91 76768 04398: I wish I could do that but I'm stuck with my project
26/09/22, 8:31 pm - +91 70734 10928: Okay thank you.
And for the encoding, what should be use like pandas dummy_index function or skelearn OneHotEncoder ? And what if we have to do ordinal encoding , label encoding and one hot encoding in the same dataframe then what will your approach?
26/09/22, 8:31 pm - +91 70734 10928: Can you please elaborate this more, I am so much confused with these
26/09/22, 8:33 pm - +91 89783 80243: Use scikitlearn onehot encoding and label encoding..

If there is a ranking in the features use label encoding.

If the no.of sub categories in a feature are less than 10 , use onehot encoding.

More than 10 use binary encoding..all will be available in scikitlearn

28/09/22, 1:22 pm - +91 70734 10928: Can anyone tell me how can I see all the columns that have null values? I am getting only one column that has null values but in this there are more null values as we can see in the below code when we sum up complete null values, then how can I see which column has null values because I am having 73 columns .
28/09/22, 1:23 pm - +91 89783 80243: use pd.isnull().sum() u will get  all columns data
28/09/22, 1:24 pm - +91 70734 10928: And if I am having so many null values in categorical  ( almost 7-8 columns) and numerical (6-7 columns ) both the columns then what should be the approach ?
28/09/22, 1:25 pm - +91 70734 10928: No, it is giving me same

28/09/22, 1:26 pm - +91 77108 91776: Okay
28/09/22, 1:27 pm - +91 77108 91776: How many columns are there?
28/09/22, 1:27 pm - +91 70734 10928: 73
28/09/22, 1:27 pm - +91 77108 91776: I see that's why it isn't showing
28/09/22, 1:27 pm - +91 89783 80243: pd.options.display.max_columns=100 # to see all columns
28/09/22, 1:27 pm - +91 77108 91776: You need to add a custom code for missing values
28/09/22, 1:28 pm - +91 88605 79404: Just store this in a variable...is that variable a list or dictionary?
28/09/22, 1:29 pm - +91 77108 91776: <Media omitted>
28/09/22, 1:29 pm - +91 77108 91776: You can also store it as a pandas dataframe
28/09/22, 1:30 pm - +91 70734 10928: Can you share full image of the code
28/09/22, 1:31 pm - +91 77108 91776: missing=df.isna().sum()
missing _values=pd.DataFrame({'column':df.columns,'missing_values':missing})
28/09/22, 1:32 pm - +91 77108 91776: print(missing)
28/09/22, 1:32 pm - +91 77108 91776: Your dataset has 73 columns right?
28/09/22, 1:33 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes
28/09/22, 1:33 pm - +91 77108 91776: You can take a subset of 25 rows from this dataframe and print it batch by batch
28/09/22, 1:33 pm - +91 77108 91776: It won't print 73 tho
28/09/22, 1:33 pm - +91 77108 91776: You can do this by slicing
28/09/22, 1:33 pm - +91 88605 79404: This message was deleted
28/09/22, 1:33 pm - +91 88605 79404: Or u can do one thing like a=df_train_full.isnull().sum()

Print(a[a>0])
28/09/22, 1:34 pm - +91 77108 91776: Yeah this works too
28/09/22, 1:35 pm - +91 77108 91776: If we want to nullify the columns that has no missing values
28/09/22, 1:35 pm - +91 70734 10928: This giving me the same output as I was getting before
28/09/22, 1:35 pm - +91 77108 91776: Slice the dataframe
28/09/22, 1:35 pm - +91 77108 91776: Print first 25 rows of the dataframe
28/09/22, 1:37 pm - +91 70734 10928: Oh yes this worked
28/09/22, 1:37 pm - +91 70734 10928: Thank you @918860579404 @917710891776

28/09/22, 1:38 pm - +91 70734 10928: Please answer this question also ?
28/09/22, 1:39 pm - +91 77108 91776: What are the amount of null values in categorical features?
28/09/22, 1:40 pm - +91 88605 79404: Numerical - u try to do median value imputation
28/09/22, 1:42 pm - +91 77108 91776: Either drop categorical columns
28/09/22, 1:42 pm - +91 77108 91776: Or if you want to keep them
28/09/22, 1:43 pm - +91 70734 10928: And I am having this types of columns like sunday_from_time1 , Sunday_to_time1 and like this 28 columns then should i remove these columns or I can take any insight from this ?
28/09/22, 1:43 pm - +91 77108 91776: Impute those categorical columns by 'missing' string
28/09/22, 1:43 pm - +91 88605 79404: It depends... If a category is dominating... Do mode imputation
28/09/22, 1:43 pm - +91 77108 91776: First try to take any insight if possible
28/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 70734 10928: <Media omitted>
28/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 77108 91776: Bcoz it's important
28/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 88605 79404: Or create a separate category
28/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 77108 91776: Can you try to find out what sort of values these columns store
28/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 77108 91776: By value_counts() or dtypes method
28/09/22, 1:44 pm - +91 88605 79404: Too many bull values
28/09/22, 1:45 pm - +91 88605 79404: Just cant delete these rows
28/09/22, 1:45 pm - +91 88605 79404: *null
28/09/22, 1:46 pm - +91 77108 91776: How many rows are there in the dataset?
28/09/22, 1:46 pm - +91 88605 79404: What r these columns?
28/09/22, 1:46 pm - +91 70734 10928: Median of every column , right ?
28/09/22, 1:46 pm - +91 77108 91776: Yeah but doesn't that depends on the number of missing values your column is having
28/09/22, 1:47 pm - +91 88605 79404: Don't do for these time columns...no sense to impute median values fr these
28/09/22, 1:48 pm - +91 70734 10928: These are having time
28/09/22, 1:48 pm - +91 70734 10928: <Media omitted>
28/09/22, 1:48 pm - +91 77108 91776: One more tip is that you can try to impute numerical values is to create a Regression model if the values are continuous
28/09/22, 1:48 pm - +91 77108 91776: You can delete these time columns if you want to
28/09/22, 1:49 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes but in this way, I need to drop 28 columns then is it good to drop such a big number of columns?
28/09/22, 1:50 pm - +91 88605 79404: No not delete it.... Search on google how to impute Data for time series or time based column
28/09/22, 1:50 pm - +91 77108 91776: Are there any date columns
28/09/22, 1:50 pm - +91 88605 79404: There r many techniques like carrying last value or take avg of last 10 values
28/09/22, 1:53 pm - +91 70734 10928: And other than this there are 5-6 columns that we are having only one type of values so i also need to drop them , this way I am deleting almost more than 35 columns
28/09/22, 1:53 pm - +91 88605 79404: U don't drop columns... I drop rows
28/09/22, 1:53 pm - +91 88605 79404: But don't drop rows fr time based data
28/09/22, 1:54 pm - +91 70734 10928: <Media omitted>
28/09/22, 1:55 pm - +91 70734 10928: But I don‚Äôt see any relationship of time in the context of restaurant recommendations

28/09/22, 1:58 pm - +91 88605 79404: Also for this case...u can bin yr data...like 5 to 6 pm all values ... Give a category
28/09/22, 1:58 pm - +91 88605 79404: That would make it easy
28/09/22, 1:59 pm - +91 70734 10928: Okay yes let me try in this way.

28/09/22, 3:47 pm - +91 96505 18893: I think it is UOH only because applied will want our batch to get over as soon as possible‚Ä¶ we are just their liabilities.
28/09/22, 6:07 pm - +91 88988 90243: Hi Folks,

We understand that there are confusions about the deadline for all mandatory second semester assignments submission as well as the end semester examination dates for the two theory subjects in the second semester for the August 2021 cohort students.

We wanted to clarify both of those things today. Please help us in making sure that this information reaches all official/unofficial groups that you may have so that it reaches everyone without fail.

Assignment Submission Timeline:

The final deadline for submission of second semester mandatory assignments will be on the 30th Sep 2022 (confirmed by UOH). There will not be any exceptions granted for any reasons whatsoever. Below are the mandatory assignments of Semester-02.

* PGD- Mandatory Assignment - Implement Backprop from scratch
* PGD- Mandatory Assignment - Implement CNN from scratch

End Semester Examination dates:

There were a few likely dates earlier which some of you may have heard from our team members. However, UOH has not finalized any dates for the end semester examinations yet. They have told us that they will have the final dates before the second week of October. Once we receive the final dates from them, we will communicate them to all of you via email and Slack. You can find the Exam Schedule here:

We also suggest everyone to use this schedule for referring to important deadlines for the remainder of the semester. This will be updated moving forward so please bookmark this and the sheet above.

29/09/22, 9:54 pm - +91 89715 68712: Any idea why that is? It's for back propagation assignment
29/09/22, 11:23 pm - +91 78935 55163: w_van[0] = w_van[0] - learningrate  * dw[0]

01/10/22, 11:09 am - +91 81060 40245: Hi Friends,
I‚Äôm Prasad. Enrolled with you all for this Diploma course. I‚Äôm a covid survivor. I didn‚Äôt concentrate much of the courses and didn‚Äôt write any of exams in semester 1 or in semester 2.
Now, I got a call from Applied Roots team. They are saying they would give another 6months time to complete both semester exams and courses.
I already paid for Semester 1 fee. Now they want me to pay for Semester 2 which is around 40k if I want to wish to continue.

I would need your honest suggestions friends to take it up further or not. I have been seeing all your discussions since day1, sometimes I feel I would have completed all my courses exams along with you. But situations became worst from then.
Now, shall I continue doing the diploma or not ?

I have asked a question to them, ‚Äúyou have reduced concentration on Diploma courses batch as you are acquired by Scalar‚Äù but she says now only they have more focus on the batches then previous.

Please suggest!

Thanks in advance!!

This course costs 80k

Now you yourself decide the worthiness of course material, don't think about their concentration on us, just think of the worthiness of gold mine you got with this diploma
01/10/22, 11:18 am - +91 88605 79404: Don't pay i will suggest

01/10/22, 11:39 am - +91 74062 88886: My honest review would be you complete your diploma first. For this anyway you have already paid 40k which will get wasted. Now come to worthiness of this course-

I also lost my interest in the middle but don't forget untill unless you won't have pressure to give exam, mid term, end term etc we generally won't force ourselves to learn thing. I was also not confident about  submitting any phases of my project but due to pressure of submission within time frame I went beyond my potential and submitted around 4 phases of my project. Which I think is most critical part of this course.

And believe me I learnt alot seriously during building my project. And now I am more confident what I learnt theoretically.

I would say push yourself little harder and this course will pay you back once you finish it successfully! Trust me.

Don't simply lose your hope and don't go into negative direction. We always find out other mistake easily. But we also have to accept the fact that we also have to put some effort which will surely pay you back. I hope it will help you take dicision.

PS: Don't go with negative thought. Remember your first day when you joined this course. And what was your motivation.
01/10/22, 11:41 am - +91 88605 79404: Is dr anyone who has completed 30 assignments?
01/10/22, 11:43 am - +91 94600 27985: If one has all these skills and fulfilled all the asked requirements why would anyone apply for this.

This is slavery with extra steps.

02/10/22, 1:19 pm - +91 88605 79404: What do we hv write in documentation... Colab code hi chepde
02/10/22, 1:21 pm - +91 89210 23935: Almost
02/10/22, 1:26 pm - +91 96505 18893: I think we can never be done with the code as we keep on improving the features, keep on try various tools for better results.  We should stop at some point and submit it. It is not a normal code that should pass all the test cases and then we are done. It is a work in progress. Thats y we will be called data scientist as we need to keep on experimenting different techniques. And every technique has its pros and cons.
02/10/22, 1:27 pm - +91 88605 79404: What do we hv to write in documentation? Any idea..
02/10/22, 1:28 pm - +91 88605 79404: Except phase 1... We i hav colab notebooks

02/10/22, 1:40 pm - +91 99721 79093: My model accuracy is decreasing after feature engineering ü§£ , what should I do for Phase 4
02/10/22, 1:43 pm - +91 96505 18893: U can put it like what not to do when doing feature engg
02/10/22, 1:48 pm - +91 77748 96465: Write your observations...feature engineering is not recommended

02/10/22, 2:29 pm - +91 77748 96465: You will have to ask mentors

03/10/22, 9:48 am - +91 91824 44341: As it is said that 
Yesterday is last date and No Further extensions will be encouraged
03/10/22, 9:53 am - +91 89783 80243: if your able to upload the documents in classroom. do it without any second thought
03/10/22, 9:59 am - +91 88988 90243: If this is through local machine then

Print as pdf

Or upload your notebook in google collab and then download as pdf
03/10/22, 11:16 am - +91 99998 58727: Okay I can try this
03/10/22, 10:15 pm - +91 96184 80572: Hi when I try to convert eda file from ipynb to html few plots are missing in the generated html file. Can someone pl tell how to resolve this issue
03/10/22, 10:17 pm - +91 88988 90243: ^
03/10/22, 10:17 pm - +91 74062 88886: That's ok .. because anyway you are going to submit ipynb file also.. so no worry. Upload both the file.

I would suggest instead of saving as html- u can directly convert into pdf by simply clicking on print option.
03/10/22, 10:25 pm - +91 96184 80572: Okay thanks
03/10/22, 10:49 pm - +91 93464 10791: Everybody's submission got evaluated? Are there people whose project submission is still in pending state?

05/10/22, 12:00 am - +91 88988 90243: Depends on the data 
 Example, if I have forecasting problem. 
Data has a column *Event name* which includes values such as Diwali, Christmas etc
Here more than 90% of data will be null, but still it is important to me

05/10/22, 2:37 pm - +91 92050 16234: This error is in heroku while deploying. Will reinstalling packsges help here? Because i think heroku installs packages from requirements.txt? Also you are suggesting to reinstall packages in local system?
05/10/22, 2:44 pm - +91 99125 51007: I tried running my program in laptop 16gb ram, sometimes it is errored out with memory insufficient , but bought google colab pro with 32gb memory but this program was never completed in colab always crashed.

05/10/22, 5:12 pm - +91 75298 81000: Anyone can volunteer to answer this. Last year i faced this thing too.
1. How dataframes are stored in memory RAM?
05/10/22, 5:19 pm - +91 95813 23427: based on the size of dataset
05/10/22, 5:21 pm - +91 83329 81498: It's possible that colab handles memory thresholds differently. As in, once you hit the limit and continue to do it, crash the session. However when you run locally there's no such rule.
05/10/22, 5:22 pm - +91 95813 23427: in free tier colab session expires after sometime it causes issues. not sure of pro one
05/10/22, 5:23 pm - +91 83329 81498: Colab Pro also has timeouts but they offer longer idle runtimes if I'm not wrong.
05/10/22, 5:23 pm - +91 88605 79404: Try to use libraries like dask
05/10/22, 5:24 pm - +91 95813 23427: use dask is some what complex, not all libraries support it
05/10/22, 5:26 pm - +91 88605 79404: Then only u can reduce yr data n perform...like taking less rows...
05/10/22, 5:28 pm - +91 95813 23427: split data, train multiple models and take an estimate of all outputs
05/10/22, 5:29 pm - +91 88605 79404: How will you split when whole data is not loading into ram
05/10/22, 5:30 pm - +91 95813 23427: use dask for it
05/10/22, 5:30 pm - +91 75298 81000: Try to load top k rows
05/10/22, 5:30 pm - +91 95813 23427: also an option
05/10/22, 5:41 pm - +1 (647) 894-3728: How dask functions ?
05/10/22, 5:50 pm - +91 95813 23427: dask doesn't load all data at once. it loads kind of on demand

On every execution of ur streamlit app the 1gb github allocated bandwidth will run out and then u have to buy bandwidth on GitHub.

So test on local system and run once if ur code is stable for production.

10/10/22, 8:21 pm - +91 73825 54571: U jus prepare fr it
10/10/22, 8:30 pm - +91 70877 58526: I had implemented a encoder - decoder architecture. 
I used DenseNet121 in encoder- 
There were questions about the architecture,  difference between convolution and max pooling layers. Why skip connection are used, What problems did they solved. Questions related to code and activation functions. 
Then for decoder I implemented GRUs so questions related the gates in lstms and GRUs. What problems did they solve in comparison to basic RNN. I explained the deployment part and showed the demo.
10/10/22, 8:31 pm - +91 73825 54571: Ohh
10/10/22, 8:31 pm - +91 73825 54571: Should we show the demo???
10/10/22, 8:32 pm - +91 88605 79404: I think I need to revise a lot
10/10/22, 8:35 pm - +91 6354 062 356: How long is the viva .. how they will complete 4/5 people in one hour schedule?
10/10/22, 8:40 pm - +91 88988 90243: Who took viva? 
Anyone from applied roots team?

11/10/22, 11:46 am - +91 74061 90889: What questions were asked ??
11/10/22, 11:46 am - +91 98666 19981: Less than 5 to 10 mins.
11/10/22, 11:47 am - +91 98666 19981: For me about convolution, what models you have used, what metrics, what approaches you have taken.
11/10/22, 11:47 am - +91 98666 19981: General stuff yaar.
11/10/22, 11:47 am - +91 98666 19981: But maybe it also depends on the mentor.

11/10/22, 2:23 pm - +91 90529 47300: üòä we can't pay him
11/10/22, 2:28 pm - +91 98666 19981: When you say experience of data science what kind of works can be considered under it?
11/10/22, 2:31 pm - +91 98666 19981: Let's say I do a power bi visualisations and it is a part of data science tools. So does my work come under it? Or a task automation using python? Or being an SQL developer? Or a tableau dashboard developer?
11/10/22, 2:37 pm - +91 90529 47300: It should be related to data. Understanding of data ecosystem is important.
11/10/22, 2:37 pm - +91 90529 47300: If you have related also please share, everything is JD is not important. Even if it matches 60% it's fine
11/10/22, 2:40 pm - +91 98666 19981: No i don't have it. But just the question poped up. And i thought it's a very good point of discussion... To discuss with you all..
11/10/22, 2:41 pm - +91 98666 19981: And to be honest iam doing one of the things which i said and i don't feel that iam going into data science field it's more into automating manual tasks.
11/10/22, 2:43 pm - +91 98666 19981: And if i want to shift to some job related to data science. And if the interviewer asks me what did you do in your previous company regarding data science. Then i don't see anything. It's more of automation using python, extracting data using some simple SQL statements. And bits of power bi here and there.
11/10/22, 2:46 pm - +91 96442 25489: Projects might help
11/10/22, 2:48 pm - +91 98666 19981: I guess you are taking about personal projects right!
11/10/22, 2:49 pm - +91 96442 25489: Yup
11/10/22, 2:51 pm - +91 96442 25489: + if that's related to the projects that company is working on, that's definitely going to help
11/10/22, 3:00 pm - +91 98666 19981: That's true.
11/10/22, 4:57 pm - +91 89399 22582: Hi, did anyone got extension to submit the project or any other alternate
11/10/22, 7:37 pm - +91 96442 25489: Where to find the link for viva
11/10/22, 7:42 pm - +91 83088 87324: In mail means they hv definitely send mail
11/10/22, 7:44 pm - +91 96442 25489: By which mail id?

12/10/22, 11:00 pm - +91 70734 10928: Can anyone please tell me, when do one hot encoding then no. Of features increases , after this how we will use those increased features in streamlit app ? Like how we will know the names of those columns ?
12/10/22, 11:04 pm - Abhinaya Uoh Project: I think you must store it as  pickle file and load it there. Please check.

12/10/22, 11:06 pm - +91 70734 10928: Apart from model ? Should I need to store all the column names ?
12/10/22, 11:10 pm - +91 77108 91776: Are your features binary?
12/10/22, 11:10 pm - +91 77108 91776: Does it contains two values or more than two values?
12/10/22, 11:10 pm - +91 70734 10928: Not all the features
12/10/22, 11:10 pm - +91 70734 10928: Some are having more than 2 and some only two
12/10/22, 11:11 pm - +91 77108 91776: For binary, you can use sklearn one hot encoder
12/10/22, 11:12 pm - +91 77108 91776: Set the drop ti if_binary
12/10/22, 11:12 pm - +91 88988 90243: Did you do data pre processing on evaluation dataset?
12/10/22, 11:13 pm - +91 70734 10928: Sorry , I didn‚Äôt get you
12/10/22, 11:13 pm - +91 70734 10928: And for having more than one value ?
12/10/22, 11:13 pm - +91 77108 91776: He's asking that whether you've done preprocessing on validation dataset
12/10/22, 11:14 pm - +91 88988 90243: Understood
You need to add prefix
12/10/22, 11:16 pm - +1 (647) 894-3728: There are other types of encoding also.
12/10/22, 11:16 pm - +1 (647) 894-3728: Go through that
12/10/22, 11:16 pm - +91 77108 91776: Yeah he's right
12/10/22, 11:16 pm - +91 70734 10928: Actually before doing one hot encoding I was having 19 features and all those features names I know before that but after doing one hot encoding no. Of features increases to 20 and now I don‚Äôt know which feature has increased because I have used this data in model building and after this if I build a streamlit app for all these features then I should put names of all 20 features on which I have trained my model
12/10/22, 11:17 pm - +91 77108 91776: For features with more than 2 categorical values, How many unique values are there?
12/10/22, 11:17 pm - +91 70734 10928: 2 and 3
12/10/22, 11:18 pm - +91 77108 91776: Okay I see
12/10/22, 11:22 pm - +91 77108 91776: Try to set sparse flag to False
12/10/22, 11:22 pm - +91 77108 91776: Fit it again and see what value it might return
12/10/22, 11:22 pm - +91 70734 10928: This is already set as false
12/10/22, 11:23 pm - +91 77108 91776: Okay
12/10/22, 11:24 pm - +91 77108 91776: Can you do a value count of more than 2 categorical features?
12/10/22, 11:25 pm - +91 77108 91776: Values*
12/10/22, 11:25 pm - +91 77108 91776: And then try to do OHE Based on that
12/10/22, 11:26 pm - +91 77108 91776: And then set the drop flag to if_binary?

12/10/22, 11:45 pm - +91 77108 91776: There might be some issue with your model file
12/10/22, 11:46 pm - +91 77108 91776: Have you updated the model file?
12/10/22, 11:46 pm - +91 77108 91776: You need to run your model with 19 features
12/10/22, 11:46 pm - +91 77108 91776: The model is already pretrained with 20 features
12/10/22, 11:47 pm - +91 70734 10928: Yes, but the no. Of features is increased due to encoding if I don‚Äôt do that then data will not process
12/10/22, 11:48 pm - +91 77108 91776: Can you apply different encoding rather than ohe
12/10/22, 11:48 pm - +91 77108 91776: ?
12/10/22, 11:49 pm - +91 70734 10928: Okay let me check once
12/10/22, 11:51 pm - +91 77108 91776: For more than 2 categorical values
12/10/22, 11:54 pm - +91 77108 91776: I would suggest you to use OHE for features with two categorical values

14/10/22, 12:08 am - +91 74062 88886: Exam Schedules are out now-

We have got the Mid-Term exam schedule for those who have missed some how. So they are given last and i think final chance. So that they can attend the End Term exam.

And we got the schedule for End-Term exam also. So everyone have to attend it. 

This time we got alternative dates for both exams. Mid-Term as well as End-Term. So we can attend exam as per our convenience based on the dates given. 

Constraint is we can give exam only once for a subject.

Hope this clarifies most of the doubts.

15/10/22, 12:42 am - +91 91508 89863: hey guys just a suggestion. appliedai is conducting revision session nowadays but there are lot of complex things in course which can be further simplified and lot of uncovered topics so can we all request the team to conduct livesession on complex topics and uncovered topics instead of revision. i feel like there is no use of revission session as we have learnt everything already
15/10/22, 12:44 am - +91 91508 89863: btw how do you guys do hyperparameter tuning in deeplearning for images and lstm any good pointers towards this. only thing i can thing of is try chaning the nontrainable parameters in last few layers of cnn what techniques do you guys follow
15/10/22, 12:45 am - +91 91508 89863: if enough people ask they may consider this
